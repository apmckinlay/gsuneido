<h2>Running Totals on a Report</h2>

<p><b>Category:</b> Reports</p>

<p><b>Problem</b></p>

<p>You want a column on a report that is a running total of another column.</p>

<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>

<p><a href="../Reports/Reference/QueryFormat.html">QueryFormat</a>, <a href="../Reports/Reference/RowFormat.html">RowFormat</a>, <a href="../Reports/Reference/NumberFormat.html">NumberFormat</a></p>

<p><b>Recipe</b></p>

<p>Enter this in a library (e.g. mylib) as My_RunningTotal:</p>

<pre>
#(Params
    title: "Running Total Report"
    QueryFormat
        {
        Query: "tables"
        Before()
            {
            .running_total = 0
            return False
            }
        BeforeOutput(data)
            {
            .running_total += data.totalsize
            data.running_total = .running_total
            return False
            }
        Output: (Row tablename totalsize (Number field: running_total
            mask: '###,###,###', heading: 'Running\nTotal'))
        })
</pre>

<p>You can then run it from the WorkSpace with:</p>

<pre>
Window(My_RunningTotal)
</pre>

<p><b>Discussion</b></p>

<p>This example uses "tables" - a system table that stores information about the tables themselves. One of its fields is "totalsize" - the amount of space used by each table. This is the field that
we are making a running total of.</p>

<p>The first step is to initialize the running total in Before. Notice that we have to return False since we don't want to print anything.</p>

<p>Then, in BeforeOutput, we update the running total and then add it to the "data" - the current record. Again we return False since we don't want to print anything.</p>

<p>Finally, we specify a RowFormat for our Output. "tablename" and "totalsize" are actual fields in the table that have Field_ definitions so we can simply specify their field names. Since we haven't
made a Field_ definition for "running_total" we need to specify it's format (a NumberFormat). Notice the newline (\n) used to make a multi-line column heading.</p>

<p>QueryFormat also has a built in "Total" facility for accumulating totals correctly for different sort breaks.</p>
