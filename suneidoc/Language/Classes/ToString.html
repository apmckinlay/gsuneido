<h3>ToString</h3>

<p>If a instance has a <code>ToString()</code> method it will be used by <a href="../Reference/Display.html">Display</a> (and therefore <a href="../Reference/Print.html">Print</a> and other functions that use Display). It will also be used by string concatenation ($).</p>

<p>This can be very useful for debugging so you can see the contents of class objects.</p>

<p>Consider writing a ToString() method for your classes.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
Point
class
    { 
    New(x, y)
        { 
        .x = x
        .y = y
        } 
    ...
    ToString() 
        { 'Point(x:' $ Display(.x) $ ', y: ' $ Display(.y) $ ')' }
    }

Point(12, 34)
    => Point(x: 12, y: 34)
</pre>

<p>Without the ToString method you would only see:</p>
<pre>
Point(12, 34)
    => Point()
</pre>

<p>Note: When possible, it is a good idea to make ToString's output match the syntax that would be used to create the instance, as in the Point example above.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: ToString only works on instances, not on the class itself.</p>
