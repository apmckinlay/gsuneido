<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In Suneido, classes are read-only collections of named members and methods. Classes can derive/inherit from other classes. Instances can be created from a class. Instance inherit the members and methods of their class. Instances cannot define methods - method lookup starts in the class. (You can store a function in a member, but you cannot call it like a method.) Instances can override data members from their class.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> In Suneido, classes are <i>values</i>. This means they can be assigned to variables, passed to other functions, etc.</p>

<p>Class literals are written as follows:</p>

<p>class:</p>
<pre>
<b>class</b> { members }
<b>class</b> <i>Base</i> { members }
<b>class</b> : <i>Base</i> { members }
<i>Base</i> { members } // same as class : Base { members }
</pre>

<p>member:</p>
<pre>
name: literal
name ( params ) { statements } // short for name: function (params)
</pre>

<p>Class members may be optionally separated by semicolons.</p>

<p>Instances of classes are created with:</p>
<pre>
new class
new class ( arguments )
</pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: new should not be used with built-in classes such as Object or File.</p>

<p>Since this is also the default definition of CallClass, instances of most classes can also be created by "calling" the class:</p>
<pre>
class ( <i>arguments</i> )
</pre>

<p>For example, you could create a stack with:</p>

<pre>new Stack()</pre>

<p>or just:</p>

<pre>Stack()</pre>

<p>String concatenation ($) is allowed in string literal members. This concatenation is done at compile time. This primarily useful for formatting source code. For example:</p>
<pre>
class
    {
    message: "now is the time\n" $
             "for all good men\n"
    }
</pre>

<p>The following methods are available on classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Base.html">.Base</a></li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Base?.html">.Base?</a></li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Eval.html">.Eval</a></li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Eval2.html">.Eval2</a></li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Iter.html">.Iter</a> - only iterates the members of the instance, not its classes</li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.GetDefault.html">.GetDefault</a> - includes inherited members</li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Member?.html">.Member?</a> - includes inherited members</li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Members.html">.Members</a> - includes inherited members with all:</li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Method?.html">.Method?</a></li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.MethodClass.html">.MethodClass</a></li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Readonly?.html">.Readonly?</a> - always true for classes</li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Size.html">.Size</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Instances of classes also support:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Copy.html">.Copy</a></li>
<li><a href="../Reference/Object/object.Delete.html">.Delete</a></li>
</ul>
