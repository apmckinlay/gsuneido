<h3>Getter Methods</h3>

<p>If a non-existent member is accessed, Suneido will look first for a method named "Getter_", and then for a method named "Getter_" $ name (for public members) or "getter_" $ name (for private members). If a <i>getter</i> method is found it will be called and the value of the member will be whatever the method returns. Getter_ is called with the name of the member being accessed. This allows members to be implemented as data or functions without altering client code.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
myClass = class { i: 0, Getter_Num() { return .i++; } }
x = new myClass
Assert(x.Num is 0)
Assert(x.Num is 1)
</pre>

<p>Getters can be used to defer calculation of a value until it is first used, and to cache that value for further use:</p>
<pre>
myClass = class { N: 0, Getter_Num( ) { ++.N; return .Num = 123; } }
x = new myClass
Assert(x.Num is 123)
Assert(x.Num is 123)
Assert(x.N is 1) // Getter_Num() should only be called once
</pre>
<p>Because we set the member, the getter will no longer be called. (Because actual members take precedence over getters.)</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: To work correctly with <a href="../Reference/Object/object.GetDefault.html">object.GetDefault</a>, Getter_ should return <i>nothing</i> for "missing" members. For example:</p>
<pre>
Getter_(member)
    {
    if .data.Member?(member)
        return .data[member]
    else
        return
    }
</pre>

<p>Notice that if the member is not available, it is not returning false or "" or any other value, it is using a return with <u>no</u> value.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> For private members, the member name passed to Getter_ will be "privatized", i.e. it will be prefixed with the class name.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Previously (prior to 2019), getters were named "Get_" and "get_" but these were not specific/unique enough.</p>
