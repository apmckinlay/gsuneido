<h3>this</h3>

<p>Within class member functions the keyword <code>this</code> refers to the object (class instance) that the member function was called from.</p>

<p>Note: <code>this</code> may not be assigned to.</p>

<p>Within class methods, <code>this.member</code> may be abbreviated to just <code>.member</code></p>

<p>Note: Because private member names are prefixed with the name of their class</p>

<pre>this["private_member"]</pre>

<p>will not work. (The actual member name will be of the form "Class_private_member".)</p>
