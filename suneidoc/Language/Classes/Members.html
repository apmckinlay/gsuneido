<h3>Members</h3>

<p>Within classes, member names starting with a lower case letter are <i>private</i>. Member names starting with an upper case letter are <i>public</i>.</p>

<p>Private members are implemented by internally prefixing them with their class name.</p>
<pre>
MyClass
class
    {
    <b>foo:</b> 123
    Bar()
        {
        return <b>.foo</b>
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>Internally, both of the foo's will become "MyClass_foo".</p>

<pre>MyClass.Members() => #("MyClass_foo", "Bar")</pre>

<p>So access from outside the class (e.g. MyClass.foo) will throw an exception (member not found).</p>

<p>Private members can still be accessed from outside the class by using the internal name (e.g. x.MyClass_foo), but this is <u>not</u> recommended except for tests. </p>
