<h3>Default</h3>

<p>When a member function is called, if the member does not exist, then a member function called "Default" is called with the member name as the first argument and the remaining arguments from the original call.</p>

<p>For example, to forward unrecognized method calls to another object:</p>
<pre>
class
    {
    ...
    Default(@args)
        {
        return .other[args[0]](@+1args);
        }
</pre>
