<h3>RunOnGui</h3>

<pre>(block) => killer</pre>

<p>Queues the block to run from the main GUI thread message loop. The block is run from a shared 10ms (the minimum) Windows timer. Timers have low priority so if the UI is busy there may be additional delays.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: RunOnGui can only be used from non GUI threads.</p>

<p>killer.Kill() will remove the block from the pending queue <b>if it is still there</b>.</p>
