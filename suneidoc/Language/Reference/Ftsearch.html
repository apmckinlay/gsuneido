<h3>Ftsearch</h3>

<p>Full text index and search. Uses a Snowball stemmer and BM25 scoring.</p>

<dl class="code">
<dt>Ftsearch.Tokens(string) => object</dt>
<dd>Returns a list of processed tokens from the string. This is for debugging.</dd>
<pre>
Ftsearch.Tokens("business selling is 343-8887 401k foo123")
=> #("busi", "sell", "343-8887", "343", "8887", "401k", "401", "foo123", "foo", "123")
</pre>

<dt>Ftsearch.Create() => builder</dt>
<dd>Creates a "builder" that is used to build a search index.</dd>

<dt>builder.Add(id, title, text)</dt>
<dd>The id should be a small integer. Gaps in the numbering will increase memory usage.</dd>

<dd>The title is indexed along with the text, but the words in it are treated as more important.</dd>

<dt>builder.Pack() or index.Pack() => data</dt>
<dd>Returns the index as a single binary string.</dd>

<dt>FtSearch.Load(data) => index</dt>
<dd>Loads the index so it can be searched.</dd> 

<dt>index.Search(query, scores = false) => list</dt>
<dd>Searches the index for the words in the query. It returns a list of the top 20 matching document ids, highest scoring first. If scores is true, the results are objects containing id and score.</dd>

<dt>index.Update(id, oldTitle, oldText, newTitle, newText)</dt>
<dd>If oldTitle and oldText aren't empty it removes them from the index.
Note: They should exactly match what was previously added to the index.
If newTitle and newText aren't empty it adds them to the index. (Like build.Add)
Note: index.Update is less efficient than builder.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
builder = Ftsearch.Create()
builder.Add(0, "First", "Now is the time")
builder.Add(1, "Second", "This is not the first document")
data = builder.Pack()
index = Ftsearch.Load(data)
Print(index.Search("nonexistent"))
Print(index.Search("TIME"))
Print(index.Search("first", scores:))
Print(index.Search("first time", scores:))
=>	#()
	#(0)
	#(#(id: 0, score: .2865053035333572), #(id: 1, score: .16044296997868))
	#(#(id: 0, score: .9796524840933026), #(id: 1, score: .16044296997868))
</pre>

<h4>Limits</h4>

<p>id's must be in the range 0 to 64k</p>

<p>The maximum number of unique terms (stemmed words) is 64k</p>

<p>The highest count of a particular term in a document is 255.
After that the count just sticks at 255.</p>

<p>Single letters or digits are not indexed.</p>

<p>Terms longer than 32 characters are not indexed.</p>
