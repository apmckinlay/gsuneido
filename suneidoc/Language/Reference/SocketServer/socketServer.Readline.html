<h4>socketServer.Readline</h4>

<p>Returns the next line from the socket connection.</p>

<pre>() => string</pre>

<p>Returns the next line from the socket connection.</p>

<p>Looks for newline characters ('\n') as line terminators. The newline is <b>not</b> included in the returned string.</p>

<p>Trailing carriage returns ('\r') are also removed from the resulting lines. (Returns within lines are not removed or treated as line terminators.)</p>

<p>For example, input of "one\rONE\ntwo\r\nthree\r\r\nfour" would result in lines of "one\rONE", "two", "three", and "four".</p>

<p>Final lines are returned the same, whether or not they have terminating returns or newlines.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> There is a line length limit of 4000 bytes. If a line exceeds this, only the first 4000 bytes will be returned, although the entire line will be processed.</p>

<p>In case of a lost connection or timeout, if partial data has been received it will be returned. i.e. the returned string may not always be a complete line.</p>

<p>An exception will be thrown (<code>"lost connection or timeout"</code>) if the connection is lost or the timeout is exceeded.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> There is a maximum line length of 2000 characters. If a line exceeds this length the first 2000 characters will be returned and the remainder of the line will be discarded.</p>
