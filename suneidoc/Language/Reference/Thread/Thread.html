<h3>Thread</h3>

<pre>(callable, name = false)</pre>

<p>Thread creates a new thread to run the specified function or class. Thread returns immediately, without waiting for the new thread.</p>

<p>If a name is supplied it has the same effect as doing <a href="Thread.Name.html">Thread.Name</a>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
f = function ()
    {
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
        {
        Beep()
        for (j = 0; j &lt; 1000000; ++j)
            {} // delay
        }
    }
Thread(f)
</pre>

<p>This will beep 10 times, while allowing you to continue to work.</p>

<p><a href="../SocketServer.html">SocketServer</a> creates threads for each accepted connection.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Code run by Thread should not access the Windows GUI. i.e. it should not get or set anything to do with windows or controls. A Thread can use <a href="../RunOnGui.html">RunOnGui</a> to run code on the main thread to update the GUI.</p>
