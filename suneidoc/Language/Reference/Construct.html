<h3>Construct</h3>

<pre>
( class, suffix="" ) => object
( object, suffix="" ) => object
</pre>

<p>Creates an instance of a class.  class can be either an actual class or else a string that is combined with suffix to get the class name.
</p>

<p>If an object is passed instead of just a class [0] is taken as the class, and the rest of the object (@+1) is passed as arguments.
</p>

<p>For example:
</p>

<pre>
Construct( Object ) => Object( )
Construct( "Object" ) => Object( )
Construct( #( Object, 1, 2, 3 ) ) => Object(1, 2, 3)
Construct( 'Button', 'Control' ) => ButtonControl( )
</pre>

Construct is used primarily for user interface controls and report formats. The normal way to construct an instance of a class is to use "new" or call the class. (See <a href="../Classes/Overview.html">Classes Overview</a>)
