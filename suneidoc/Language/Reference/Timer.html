<h3>Timer</h3>

<pre>Timer(reps = 1, secs = false) { ... } => number</pre>

<p>If secs is false, Timer executes the supplied block reps number of times and returns the elapsed time used.</p>

<p>If secs is supplied, Timer executes the supplied block repeatedly for the specified amount of time and returns the number of repetitions.</p>

<p>Timer uses <a href="Date/Date.html">Date()</a>
and <a href="Date/date.MinusSeconds.html">date.MinusSeconds()</a>.
Because of their accuracy you should normally time for a few seconds at least.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
Timer(reps: 100)
    {
    Sleep(10)
    }
=> 1.003

Timer(secs: 3)
    {
    Sleep(10)
    }
=> 304
</pre>
