<h3>Unload</h3>

<pre>(string = false)</pre>

<p>Removes the definition of the named global. Used by Library View to remove old values when definitions are changed.</p>

<p>If called without a name i.e. Unload() it unloads all library globals from memory, similar to the effect of <a href="Use.html">Use</a> or <a href="Unuse.html">Unuse</a>. <b>Note</b>: This should not be done lightly (or frequently) since it can have significant impact on performance.</p>
