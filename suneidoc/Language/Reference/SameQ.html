<h3>Same?</h3>

<pre>(x, y) => true/false</pre>

<p>Returns true if the two values refer to the same object. In Suneido, is or == compare values so two objects with the same contents will be equal, even though they are different objects.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
x = Object(123, m: 456)
y = Object(123, m: 456)
x is y
    => true
Same?(x, y)
    => false
y = x
Same?(x, y)
    => true
</pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: Same? is for special uses, normal code should just use is/==</p>
