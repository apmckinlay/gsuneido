<h3>Display</h3>

<pre>(value, quotes = 0) => string</pre>

<p>Returns a string version of any value.
Where reasonable, the resulting string can be evaluated to get an equal value back. However, Display is intended for human use; it is NOT intended as a way of converting data to and from strings.</p>

<p>The quotes argument can be:</p>
<p>
0 = default behavior - single-quotes for single characters, double-quotes unless single or back-quotes would require less escaping<br />
1 = single-quotes<br />
2 = double-quotes
</p>

<p>All non-printable characters will be escaped, including tab (\t), return (\r), and linefeed (\n).</p>
