<h3>PubSub</h3>

<dl class="code">
<dt>Subscribe(event, handler) => handle</dt>
<dd>Registers that handler should be called when event is published. Returns an object that can be used to Unsubscribe</dd>

<dt>Publish(event)</dt>
<dd>Calls all the subscribers.</dd>
</dl>

<p>event is normally a string</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Subscribers are called in the publisher's thread. If the Publish can be from a secondary thread (not the main UI thread) it is the subscriber's responsibility to use <a href="RunOnGui.html">RunOnGui</a> if they require it.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
New()
	{
	.sub = PubSub.Subscribe(#myevent, .handle_myevent)
	}
handle_myevent()
	{
	...
	}
...
Destroy()
	{
	.sub.Unsubscribe()
	}
</pre>
