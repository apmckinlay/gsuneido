<h4>object.Members</h4>

<pre>() or (list:) or (named:) or (all:) => sequence</pre>

<p>Returns a sequence of the member names of the object. The initial un-named  members are listed first, in order, then the named members. If <b>list:</b> is specified then only the initial un-named members are included.</p>

<p>For classes or instances, you can do Members(all:) to include inherited members.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
ob = #(12, 34, a: 56, b: 78)
ob.Members()
    => #(0, 1, #b, #a)
ob.Members(list:)
    => #(0, 1)
ob.Members(named:)
    => #(#b, #a)
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> The list: members are the consecutive integer members starting at zero. If a number is "missing" then subsequent numbers will go into the named: members. For example:</p>
<pre>
ob = Object(11, 22, 33, 44)
ob.Members(list:)
    => #(0, 1, 2, 3)
ob.Erase(2)
    => #(11, 22, 3: 44)
ob.Members(list:)
    => #(0, 1)
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> The named members are in no particular order since objects are implemented as hash tables.</p>

<p>The returned sequence is initially "virtual", i.e. it is simply an iterator over the original data. If you only iterate over the sequence (e.g. using a for-in loop) then an object containing all the values is never instantiated. However, if you access the sequence in most other ways (e.g. call a built-in object method on it) then a list will be created with the values from the sequence and that list is what will be used for any future operations.

<p>Note: When testing on the WorkSpace, the variable display will trigger instantiation of any sequences in local variables.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>: Since the sequence just iterates over the original object, you can get "object modified during iteration" errors. This can be avoided by forcing a copy of the sequence with .Copy()</p>
