<h4>object.Set_readonly</h4>

<pre>() => this</pre>

<p>Set the object to read-only i.e. so it can no longer be modified.</p>

<p>If an object (or record) will be shared between concurrent threads it is a good idea to make it read-only.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
ob = Object()
ob.num = 123
ob.Set_readonly()
ob.num = 456
    ERROR: can't modify readonly objects
</pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: Set_readonly is recursively applied to any nested objects or records.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: When a record is read-only rules will still work, but their results can not be saved so they will be evaluated every time they are referenced.</p>
