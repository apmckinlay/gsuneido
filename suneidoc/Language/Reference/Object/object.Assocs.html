<h4>object.Assocs</h4>

<pre>() => sequence</pre>

<p>Returns a sequence of objects each containing a member name and a value.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
ob = #(12, 34, a: 56, b: 78)
ob.Assocs()
    => #(#(0, 12), #(1, 34), #(#b, 78), #(#a, 56))
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> The named members are in no particular order since objects are implemented as hash tables.</p>

<p>The returned sequence is initially "virtual", i.e. it is simply an iterator over the original data. If you only iterate over the sequence (e.g. using a for-in loop) then an object containing all the values is never instantiated. However, if you access the sequence in most other ways (e.g. call a built-in object method on it) then a list will be created with the values from the sequence and that list is what will be used for any future operations.

<p>Note: When testing on the WorkSpace, the variable display will trigger instantiation of any sequences in local variables.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>: Since the sequence just iterates over the original object, you can get "object modified during iteration" errors. This can be avoided by forcing a copy of the sequence with .Copy()</p>
