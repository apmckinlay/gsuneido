<h4>object.Eval</h4>

<pre>( fn, @args ) => value</pre>

<p>Calls fn with the supplied arguments as if it were a method of this object. 
i.e. with <i>this</i> set to this object. Applicable to objects, records, classes, and instances.</p>

<p>Returns whatever the function returns.</p>

<p>fn can be anything callable: block, function, class, or instance.</p>

<p>Eval is required because a normal function call does not propogate <i>this</i>.
i.e. A called standalone function normally does <b>not</b> have access to instance variables.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
context = Object(Name: "Fred");
fn = function () { return .Name; };
context.Eval(fn);
=> "Fred"
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> Eval does not provide access to private members since these are class specific.</p>

<p>If the first argument to Eval is a <a href="../../../Appendix/Glossary/Method.html">Method</a> the instance or class it is bound to will be ignored.</p>
