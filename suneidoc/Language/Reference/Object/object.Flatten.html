<h4>object.Flatten</h4>

<pre>() => object</pre>

<p>Returns a new object, with each value copied,
recursively extracting the members of each value that is an object. </p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
#(123, "abc", name: "Fred", age: 25).Flatten() => #(123, "abc", "Fred", 25)
#(12, (34, 56), 78) => #(12, 34, 56, 78)
#(12, (34, (56, (78)))) => #(12, 34, 56, 78)
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> Any member names are lost.</p>
