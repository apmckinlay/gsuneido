<h4>function.StopCoverage</h4>

<pre>() => object</pre>

<p>StopCoverage stops collecting coverage information and returns the accumulated results (since <a href="function.StartCoverage.html">function.StartCoverage</a> was called).</p>

<p>The returned object will have source code positions as the member names. The value for each will either be a count if counting, or else true/false. There will be an entry for each tracked statement, even if it's zero or false.</p>

<p>Note: Constant propagation may mean that some statements do not generate any code and therefore are never tracked or executed. For example:</p>
<pre>
greet = "hello"
return greet
</pre>

<p>will be compiled as: <code>return "hello"</code> and <code>greet = "hello"</code> will never be executed.</p>
