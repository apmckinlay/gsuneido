<pre>(count = false)</pre>

<p>From this point on, coverage information will be collected, until <a href="function.StopCoverage.html">function.StopCoverage</a> is called.</p>

<p>If count is true then it will track the number of times each statement is executed. Otherwise it will only track whether or not each statement is executed.</p>

<p>Note: <a href="../CoverageEnable.html">CoverageEnable</a>(true) must be called before the function is compiled.</p>
