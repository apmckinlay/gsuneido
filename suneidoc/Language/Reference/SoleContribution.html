<h3>SoleContribution</h3>

<pre>(name) => value</pre>

<p>Gets <a href="Contributions.html">Contributions</a>(). Throws an exception if there are no contributions or if there are more than one. Returns the single contribution.</p>

<p>Useful when code requires an externally defined service but you don't want to hard code the dependency. You could just reference an undefined name, but this does not give a helpful error message and doesn't document what is going on.</p>
