<h4>RunPiped</h4>

<pre>
(command) => pipe
(command) {|pipe| ... }
</pre>

<p>Runs an external program with standard input, output, and error redirected to pipes. The block form closes the pipes on exit from the block.</p>

<p>The block form is preferred since it ensures that the pipes are closed.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
RunPiped("dir")
    { |rp|
    while false isnt s = rp.Read()
        Print(s)
    }

RunPiped("ed")
    { |rp|
    rp.Write("a\n")
    rp.Write("hello world\n")
    rp.Write(".\n")
    rp.Write("Q\n")
    while false isnt s = rp.Read()
        Print(s)
    }
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> Some programs buffer their input or output (especially when they notice it is redirected). You may need to do CloseWrite before trying to read.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If the program path contains spaces, it must be enclosed in double quotes. The remaining arguments must also be properly quoted and escaped.</p>
