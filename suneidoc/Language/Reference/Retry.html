<h3>Retry</h3>

<pre>(block, maxRetries = 10, minDelayMs = 2)</pre>

<p>Retries the block up to maxRetries times with an exponential random fallback (using <a href="RetrySleep.html">RetrySleep</a>).</p>

<p>The block must throw if it fails. (Any return value is ignored.)</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>: Beware of side effects from the block. e.g. If the block sends an email, multiple emails could end up getting sent.</p>

<p>After maxRetries it will throw "Retry failed - too many retries, last error: ...". (The specific errors from earlier retries are not tracked.)</p>
