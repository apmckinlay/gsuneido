<h4>sequence.Instantiate</h4>

<pre>() => this</pre>

<p>Forces the sequence to be "instantiated" i.e. converted to a regular object.</p>

<p>Very large or infinite sequences cannot be instantiated.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Normally this is not required. Sequences will be automatically instantiated when necessary.</p>

<p>For convenience, Instantiate is also defined for objects, in which case it does nothing.</p>
