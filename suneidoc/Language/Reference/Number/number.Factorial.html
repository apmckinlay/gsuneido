<h4>number.Factorial</h4>

<pre>() => number</pre>

<p>Returns the factorial of the number. The factorial is obtained by multiplying every integer between 1 and the number (the factorial of 3 would be 3 * 2 * 1). Factorial does not handle negative numbers.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
n = 3
n.Factorial()
    => 6
n = 5
n.Factorial()
    => 120
</pre>
