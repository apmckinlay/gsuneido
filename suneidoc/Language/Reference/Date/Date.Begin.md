#### Date.Begin

``` suneido
() => #17000101
```

Returns the "earliest possible" date.

**Note:** Date.Begin() and Date.End() are "static" methods. They do not require an instance. Although Date().Begin() and Date().End() work, it is clearer (and more efficient) to use Date.Begin() and Date.End().
