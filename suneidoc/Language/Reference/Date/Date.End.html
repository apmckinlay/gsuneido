<h4>Date.End</h4>

<pre>() => #30000101</pre>

<p>Returns the "most future" date.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Date.Begin() and Date.End() are "static" methods. They do not require an instance. Although Date().Begin() and Date().End() work, it is clearer (and more efficient) to use Date.Begin() and Date.End().</p>
