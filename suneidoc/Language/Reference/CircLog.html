<h3>CircLog</h3>

<pre>
(string)
() => string
</pre>

<p>When called with an argument the string is added to the circular log. The last 500 strings are kept.</p>

<p>When called without an argument all the strings are returned separated by newlines</p>

<p>CircLog is useful for logging events and then retrieving the log in case of an error, allowing you to look at the log just before the error without the overhead of logging every event to a file.</p>
