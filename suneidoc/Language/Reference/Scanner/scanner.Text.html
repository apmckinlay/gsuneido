<h4>scanner.Text</h4>

<pre>() => string</pre>

<p>Returns the text of the current token. (The same as what scanner.Next() returned.)</p>

<p>scanner.Text and <a href="scanner.Value.html">scanner.Value</a> are almost the same, except for strings, where Value will not include the quotes and will handle escapes (e.g. converting \t to a tab character) whereas Text will be the raw source.</p>
