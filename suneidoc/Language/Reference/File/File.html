<h4>File</h4>

<pre>
(filename, mode = "r") => file
(filename, mode = "r") {|file| ... }
</pre>

<p>Create a file object for accessing a file.</p>

<p>File is based on the standard stream io functions 
(e.g. fopen, fclose, fflush, fread, fwrite, fseek, ftell).</p>

<p>The <i>mode</i> specifies the type of access for the file:</p>

<dl class="code">
<dt><b>"r"</b></dt>
<dd>Open a file for reading. 
If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, an exception will be thrown:
"File: can't open '<i>filename</i>' for r".</dd>

<dt><b>"w"</b></dt>
<dd>Create an empty file for writing. 
If the file exists, its contents are destroyed.</dd>

<dt><b>"a"</b></dt>
<dd>Open a file for writing at the end of the file (appending); 
creates the file if it doesn’t exist.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When a file is opened with <code>"a"</code>, 
all write operations occur at the end of the file.
This means existing data cannot be overwritten.
Seek is not allowed.</p>

<p>It's normally safer to use the block form of File 
to ensure the file gets closed even if there are exceptions.</p>

<p>For example, to process a file 1000 bytes at a time:</p>
<pre>
File(source)
	{|src|
	File(destination, "w")
		{|dst|
		while false isnt s = src.Read(1000)
			{
			s2 = Process(s)
			dst.Write(s2)
			}
		}
	}
</pre>
