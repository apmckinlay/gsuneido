<h4>file.Close</h4>

<p>Close a file object.</p>

<p>File's should always be closed when you have finished using them.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> You cannot rename or delete a file while it is open.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
f = File("tmp", "w")
f.Writeline("hello world")
f.Close()
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> It's often safer to use the block form of File 
to ensure the file gets closed even if there are exceptions.
For example:</p>
<pre>
File("tmp", "w")
    { |f|
    f.Writeline("hello world")
    }
</pre>
