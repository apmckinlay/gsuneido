<h4>file.Readline</h4>

<pre>() => string or false</pre>

<p>Returns the next line from a file, or false if at the end.</p>

<p>Looks for newline characters ('\n') as line terminators. The newline is <b>not</b> included in the returned string.</p>

<p>Trailing carriage returns ('\r') are also removed from the resulting lines. (Returns within lines are not removed or treated as line terminators.)</p>

<p>For example, input of "one\rONE\ntwo\r\nthree\r\r\nfour" would result in lines of "one\rONE", "two", "three", and "four".</p>

<p>Final lines are returned the same, whether or not they have terminating returns or newlines.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> There is a line length limit of 4000 bytes. If a line exceeds this, only the first 4000 bytes will be returned, although the entire line will be processed.</p>

<p>For example, to copy a file a line at a time:</p>
<pre>
File("source")
    {|src|
    File("destination", "w")
        {|dst|
        while false isnt line = src.Readline()
            dst.Writeline(line)
        }
    }
</pre>
