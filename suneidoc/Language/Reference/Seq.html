<h3>Seq</h3>

<pre>(from = 0, to = int_max, by = 1) => sequence</pre>

<p>Returns a <i>sequence</i> of values starting with <b>from</b> up to, but not including <b>to</b>, in increments of <b>by</b>.</p>

<p>It is comparable to:</p>
<pre>
i = from
while (i &lt; to)
    i += by
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
Seq(3, 15, 3) => #(3, 6, 9, 12)
</pre>

<p>If only a single value is passed, it is taken as <b>to</b>, and <b>from</b> is taken as 0. For example:</p>
<pre>
Seq(4) // same as Seq(0, 4)
    => #(0, 1, 2, 3)
</pre>

<p>If no arguments are supplied, the result is an infinite sequence starting at zero. Attempts to instantiate will throw an error and Display will not attempt to show the contents.</p>

<p>The returned sequence is initially "virtual", i.e. it is simply an iterator over the original data. If you only iterate over the sequence (e.g. using a for-in loop) then an object containing all the values is never instantiated. However, if you access the sequence in most other ways (e.g. call a built-in object method on it) then a list will be created with the values from the sequence and that list is what will be used for any future operations. See also: <a href="../Basic Data Types/Sequence.html">Basic Data Types > Sequence</a></p>

<p>Note: When testing on the WorkSpace, the variable display will trigger instantiation of any sequences in local variables.</p>

<p>For example, the following does <b>not</b> generate an object with 10,000 values in it:</p>
<pre>
Seq(10000).Iter().Next()
    => 0
</pre>
