<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>Libraries contain definitions of user defined global names. A library definition must be a literal (e.g. number, string, object, function, class).</p>

<p>Suneido automatically uses the standard library "stdlib".</p>

<p>Within the redefinition of a function or class in a library, the previous definition of the global name may be referred to by preceding it with an underscore.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> _Name will only work for the Name you are re-defining. i.e. Within a re-definition of X you can refer to _X but you cannot refer to _Y</p>

<p><b>Warning:</b> Currently, you cannot save (e.g. store in the database) compiled library records that refer to _Name's.</p>

<p>The first time a global name is referenced, each of the libraries in use will be searched for its definition.</p>

<p>If a library record is added, modified, or deleted, that global name should be unloaded (so it will be re-loaded on demand). LibraryView handles this automatically, but if you modify a library record through other means (e.g. QueryView) then you should Unload it yourself.</p>

<p>Note: Built-in global names can <u>not</u> be redefined in libraries.</p>
