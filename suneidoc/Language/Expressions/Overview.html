<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Suneido includes the same set of operators as C, C++, and Java, with the addition of regular expression matching.</p>

<p>Expressions are composed of values, operators, and <a href="Function Calls.html">function calls</a>.</p>

<p>Values are either names or literals (e.g. boolean, numbers, strings, dates, objects).</p>

<p>The order of evaluation (precedence and associativity) of expressions is similar to C or C++.</p>

<pre>
++ -- not ! + - ~ (unary)
* / %
+ - $
&lt;&lt; >>
is == isnt != =~ !~
&lt; &lt;= > >=
&amp;
^
|
and &amp;&amp;
or ||
=  +=  -=  $=  >>=  &lt;&lt;=  &amp;=  |=  ^=  *=  /=  %= 
?:
|>
</pre>

<p>Unary operators and assignment operators are right-associative (evaluated right to left) all others are left-associative (evaluated from left to right).</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
this:               is the same as: 

2 + 3 * 5           2 + (3 * 5) 
1 > 2 and 3 > 4     (1 > 2) and (3 > 4) 
a = b = c           a = (b = c) 
</pre>

<p>Newlines mark the end of an expression statement, unless it is obviously incomplete e.g. inside (), [], {}, or after a binary operator.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Unlike C or C++, comma is <b>not</b> an operator. It can still be used to have multiple expressions in a for initialization or increment.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Constant expressions are evaluated at compile time. This differs slightly from runtime evaluation. For example, <code>x * 0</code> will be compiled to 0, whereas runtime evaluation could throw an exception if x is not a number. This also applies to <code>and, or, &amp;, |</code></p>
