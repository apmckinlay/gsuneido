<h3>Member Variables</h3>

<p>Member variables start with a period (e.g. .foo) They reference the member of that name within the current object (this). The lifetime of a member variable is that of its containing object.</p>

<p>Within classes, member names starting with a lower case letter are <i>private</i> to that class. Member names starting with an upper case letter are <i>public</i> i.e. can be accessed from outside the class.</p>
