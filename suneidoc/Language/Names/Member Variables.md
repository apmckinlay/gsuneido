### Member Variables

Member variables start with a period (e.g. .foo) They reference the member of that name within the current object (this). The lifetime of a member variable is that of its containing object.

Within classes, member names starting with a lower case letter are *private* to that class. Member names starting with an upper case letter are *public* i.e. can be accessed from outside the class.
