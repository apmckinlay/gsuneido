### Global Names

Global names start with an upper case letter.

The values associated with global names may only be modified by altering libraries.

Within the redefinition of a function or class in a library, the previous definition may be referred to by preceding it with an underscore.

**Note:** An underscore followed by a *lower case* letter is a [dynamic variable](<Dynamic Variables.md>).
