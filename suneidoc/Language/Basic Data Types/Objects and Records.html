<h3>Objects and Records</h3>

<p>Objects are Suneido's general-purpose containers.  They can be used as arrays, lists, records.  Objects are also used to represent instances of classes.</p>

<p>Objects only support <code>is</code> (<code>==</code>), <code>isnt</code> (<code>!=</code>), subscript <code>[]</code>, and member (.) operations.</p>

<p>Objects are equal if they have the same values and members.</p>

<p>Additional, user defined methods can be added in a class called "Objects" (or "Records").</p>

<p>Object constants can be written as follows:</p>

<p>object-constant:</p>
<pre>    # ( <i>members</i> )</pre>

<p>list-member:</p>
<pre>    constant</pre>

<p>named-members:</p>
<pre>    name: constant</pre>

<p>name:</p>
<pre>
    identifier
    number
    string
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
#(1, 2, "abc", "def")
#(name: "Joe", age: 23)
#(1, "abc", name: "Joe")
</pre>

<p>Nested object constants do not require the leading '#' for example:</p>

<pre>#(name: "Joe", children: ("Sue", "Sam"))</pre>

<p>If a string is a valid identifier the quotes are optional. The following is equivalent to the last example:</p>

<pre>#(name: Joe, children: (Sue, Sam))</pre>

<p>String concatenation ($) is allowed within object constants. This concatenation is done at compile time.</p>
<pre>
#(message: "now is the time\n" $
    "for all good men\n")
</pre>

<p>Record constants are written similarly, except with curly braces instead of parenthesis:</p>

<pre>#{name: "Joe", age: 23}</pre>

<p>Objects and Records can be created at run-time with Object(...) or Record(...) or with [...]</p>

<p>[...] when it has <b>unnamed</b> members, is a shortcut for Object(...)</p>
<pre>
Type([1, 2, 3]) => "Object"
Type([1, 2, a: 3]) => "Object"
</pre>

<p>[...] with <b>only</b> named members (or no members) is a shortcut for Record(...)</p>
<pre>
Type([a: 1, b: 2]) => "Record"
</pre>
