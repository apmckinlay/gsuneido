<h3>Date</h3>

<p>Suneido has a built-in Date type that contains both a date and a time, with millisecond precision.</p>

<p>Date literals are written as one of:</p>
<pre>
#yyyyMMdd
#yyyyMMdd.HHmm
#yyyyMMdd.HHmmss
#yyyyMMdd.HHmmssttt // where ttt is milliseconds
</pre>

<p>Time elements that are not supplied are set to zero.</p>

<p>Dates can be constructed more flexibly using the <a href="../Reference/Date/Date.html">Date constructor</a>.</p>
