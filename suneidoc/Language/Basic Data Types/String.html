<h3>String</h3>

<p>Strings literals can be written with double or single quotes.  Within one kind of quote it is ok to include the other kind.</p>

<p>Backquotes (`) can be used when you do <u>not</u> want backslashes (\) to have special meaning. This is useful for regular expressions and Windows file paths so you don't have to double the backslashes.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Unlike many languages, Suneido allows multi-line strings.</p>

<p>If a string is also a valid identifier it can be written as #name. This is commonly used when passing a member name e.g. ob.GetDefault(#mem, 0) or a method name e.g. ob.Map(#Trim)</p>

<p>The <code>$</code> and <code>$=</code> operators are used to concatenate strings.</p>

<p>Additional user defined methods can be added by defining methods in a class called "Strings". (The stdlib standard library already includes a Strings class.)</p>

<p>Strings may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>\xhh for hex character values, where h is 0-9, a-f, or A-F</li>

<li>\t for tab, \n for newline, \r for carriage return</li>

<li>\' for single quote, \" for double quote</li>

<li>\0 for a nul (zero) character</li>

<li>\\ for a literal backslash</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
"" // empty string'

' " '

"\""

"1\tIntroduction\n"

'a multi-line
string'

`c:\tmp\notes`
</pre>
