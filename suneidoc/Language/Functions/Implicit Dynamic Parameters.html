<h3>Implicit Dynamic Parameters</h3>

<p>Parameters that start with an underscore can receive an implicit value from <a href="../Names/Dynamic Variables.html">Dynamic Variables</a>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>f = function (_context) { doSomthingWith(context) }</pre>

<p>Within the function, the name is used without the underscore. If you wrote _name within the function body you would be referring to the dynamic variable, not the parameter.</p>

<p>context can be passed as a normal argument:</p>

<pre>
f(myContext)
f(context: myContext)
</pre>

<p>Or it can receive context via a dynamic variable:</p>

<pre>
_context = myContext
...
f()
</pre>

<p>The dynamic variable does not need to be set in the same function as the call, it can be set in anywhere in the sequence of calls leading here.</p>

<p>Default values can still be supplied. The default value is only used if no argument is passed and no dynamic variable is found.</p>
<pre>
f = function (_p = 0) { return p }
f()
    => 0
f(123)
    => 123
_p = 456
f()
    => 456
f(123)
    => 123
</pre>
