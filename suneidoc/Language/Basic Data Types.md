## Basic Data Types


Unlike *strongly typed* languages such as C or C++, Suneido is *dynamically typed*, meaning its values have types, not its variables. i.e. A variable can hold any type of value and can hold different types at different times.

In Suneido, functions, blocks, classes, dlls, callbacks, and structs are first class values. You can assign them to variables, pass them to functions, and write unnamed definitions.

The basic types include:
|     |
| --- |
| [Boolean](<Basic Data Types/Boolean.md>) |
| [Number](<Basic Data Types/Number.md>) |
| [String](<Basic Data Types/String.md>) |
| [Objects and Records](<Basic Data Types/Objects and Records.md>) |
| [Sequence](<Basic Data Types/Sequence.md>) |
| [Date](<Basic Data Types/Date.md>) |
