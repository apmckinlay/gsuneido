<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>There are two ways to put comments in your code:
</p>

<p><code>// text</code> All characters from // to the end of the line are ignored.
</p>

<p><code>/* ... */</code> All characters between /* and */ are ignored.
</p>

<p>Comments of the same type cannot be nested.</p>

<p>A good guideline is to use // comments within your code 
so that you can use /* ... */ comments to comment out sections of code.</p>
