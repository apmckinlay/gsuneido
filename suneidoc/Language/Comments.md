## Comments

There are two ways to put comments in your code:

`// text` All characters from // to the end of the line are ignored.

`/* ... */` All characters between /* and */ are ignored.

Comments of the same type cannot be nested.

A good guideline is to use // comments within your code 
so that you can use /* ... */ comments to comment out sections of code.
