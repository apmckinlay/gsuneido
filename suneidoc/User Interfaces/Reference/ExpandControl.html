<h3>ExpandControl</h3>

<pre>(label, control, open = false, leftAlign = false)</pre>

<p>Provides a pane that expands and contracts showing or hiding its child control.</p>

<p>The label is used as the tab caption. When the button is clicked the ExpandControl will switch between Expanded and contracted.</p>

<p>When the ExpandControl is closed it Send's NeedSummary which can be used at the controller to provide a "Summary" of the data just hidden. If the controller does not respond to NeedSummary the control can have a MakeSummary method.</p>

<p>When you have multiple ExpandControl's NeedSummary can use a source parameter and check source.Label</p>
