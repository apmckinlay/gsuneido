<h4>window.Commands</h4>

<pre>( ) => object</pre>

<p>Returns an object containing information about the commands.  This information is taken from the Commands member of the Window's control.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
Controller
    {
    Commands:(
        (Users_Manual, "F1", "Open the Suneido Help", Help)
          ...
</pre>

<p>would become:
</p>

<pre>
Window.Commands() =>
    Object(
        Suneido_Help: Object(
            accel: "F1",
            help: "Open the Suneido Help",
            bitmap: "Help"
            id: 123)
</pre>

<p>Where the id is the numeric id assigned by Mapcmd.</p>

<p>This information is used by Window and also by the ToolbarControl.</p>
