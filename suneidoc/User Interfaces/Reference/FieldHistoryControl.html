<h3>FieldHistoryControl</h3>

<pre>(width = 20, mandatory = false, selectFirst = false,
    font = "", trim = true)</pre>

<p>Derived from <a href="ChooseListControl.html">ChooseListControl</a>. Used like a <a href="FieldControl.html">FieldControl</a>, except that entries are added to the list, so that they can be chosen later rather than re-entered.</p>

<img src="../../res/ChooseListControl1.gif" />

<p>The lists are stored in Suneido.FieldHistory under the field name, e.g. Suneido.FieldHistory.FindInName.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: Currently, the history is not saved when you exit from Suneido.</p>

<p>If <b>trim</b> is true, leading and trailing whitespace will be removed.</p>
