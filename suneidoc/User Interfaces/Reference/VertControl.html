<h3>VertControl</h3>

<pre>(control, ... [overlap:])</pre>

<p>Takes a list of controls and lays them out in a vertical column, one below the other.</p>

<p>Ymin (height) and Ystretch are set to the total of the controls' values.</p>

<p>Xmin (width) and Xstretch are set to the maximum of the controls' values.</p>

<p>If displayed with a larger height, the excess space is distributed between the controls based on their Ystretch values.</p>

<p>If a control has an x stretch of 0 (instead of false) then it will stretch horizontally to fill the Vert, but will not necessarily make the Vert itself stretch horizontally. For example, to make a set of buttons all the same width:</p>
<pre>
(Vert
    (Button One xstretch: 0)
    (Button Two xstretch: 0)
    (Button Three xstretch: 0))
</pre>

<p>If <b>overlap:</b> is true, then the controls are overlapped by one pixel. This eliminates the "double" line between fields.</p>
