### InspectControl

``` suneido
(object, title = "", hwnd = 0)
```

Displays the members of an object, and its base, in a [ListBoxControl](<ListBoxControl.md>). Double clicking on a member whose value is an object will switch to inspecting that object.  This list will have \<<\< at the top; double-clicking on this will take you back to the original object.

Shift-double-click will open up a *new* inspect window for the object.
