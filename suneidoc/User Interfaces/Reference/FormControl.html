<h3>FormControl</h3>

<pre>(item [, item ...], overlap = true)</pre>

<p>Takes a list of controls and produces a layout. 'nl' (new line) items are used to mark the ends of lines.</p>

<p>Form aligns controls based on their baseline (using their Top value). This is primarily useful for text e.g.</p>

<pre>align <font size="7">align</font></pre>

<p>The major feature of FormControl is that it allows controls to be lined up in vertical groups, which do not have to be contiguous.  For example:</p>

<pre>
Window(#(Border (Form
    (id group: 0) (amount group: 1) nl
    (control group: 0) nl
    (field group: 0) (cost group: 1))))
</pre>

<p>Produces:</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Rows are overlapped by one pixel to eliminate the double line between fields. Use 'nL' instead of 'nl' to turn this off for a single row. Or use overlap:false to not overlap any row in the form.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Form does not handle stretchable controls. It ignores the stretch on its child controls and simply sizes them by their xmin and ymin.</p>
