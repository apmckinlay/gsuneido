<h3>Defer</h3>

<pre>(block) => killer</pre>

<p>Queues the block to run from the message loop, which means it will be deferred until after the current callback returns. The block is run from a shared 10ms (the minimum) Windows timer. Timers have low priority so if the UI is busy there may be delays.</p>

<p>killer.Kill() will remove the block from the pending queue <b>if it is still there</b>.</p>
