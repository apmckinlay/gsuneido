<h3>HorzControl</h3>

<pre>(control, ... [overlap:])</pre>

<p>Takes a list of controls and lays them out in a horizontal row, side by side.</p>

<p>Xmin (width) and Xstretch are set to the total of the controls' values.</p>

<p>Ymin (height) and Ystretch are set to the maximum of the controls' values.</p>

<p>If displayed with a larger width, the excess space is distributed between the controls based on their Xstretch values.</p>

<p>If a control has a y stretch of 0 then it will stretch vertically to fill the Horz, but will not necessarily make the Horz itself stretch vertically.</p>

<p>If <b>overlap:</b> is true, then the controls are overlapped by one pixel. This eliminates the "double" line between fields.</p>
