<h3>Access1Control</h3>

<p>This control is meant to be used with queries with only a single record, e.g. tables with key(). Since there is only a single record, there are no navigation controls.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
Window(#(Access1 mycompany
    title: "My Company"
    (Form
        (name group: 0) nl
        (phone group: 0) (fax group: 1) nl
        (email group: 0) nl
        (website group: 0)
        )))
</pre>

<p>would create</p>
