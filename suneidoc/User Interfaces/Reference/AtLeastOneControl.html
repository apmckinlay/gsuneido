<h3>AtLeastOneControl</h3>

<pre>(control)</pre>

<p>A <a href="PassthruController.html">PassthruController</a> that manages several true/false controls (e.g. <a href="CheckBoxControl.html">CheckBoxControl</a> or <a href="ButtonToggleControl.html">ButtonToggleControl</a>) and prevents changing all the controls to false.</p>

<p>If there are exactly two controls, toggling the only true control will automatically set the other control to true.</p>

<p>If there are more than two controls, then you cannot toggle to only true control. (You must set another control to true first.)</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: This does <u>not</u> guarantee that you always have at least one control set to true. For example, when the controls are first created they may be all false.</p>
