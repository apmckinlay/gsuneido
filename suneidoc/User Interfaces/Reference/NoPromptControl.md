### NoPromptControl

``` suneido
(field, weight = 400)
```

Uses the control from the Field_ definition, but without the Prompt.

NOTE: This control does not actually exist as a class in stdlib, but is handled in the Control class by checking for the name 'NoPrompt' in the control specification object
