<h4>Members</h4>

<tr><td width="20%">Xmin</td><td>the minimum width of the control</td></tr>

<tr><td>Xstretch</td><td>how much the width of the control can be stretched 
(0 for no stretch)</td></tr>

<tr><td>Ymin</td><td>the minimum height of the control</td></tr>

<tr><td>Ystretch</td><td>how much the height of the control can be stretched 
(0 for no stretch)</td></tr>

<p>The stretch values of the controls in a container are summed 
and any excess room in the container is distributed between the controls proportionally.
