<h2>Crash Recovery</h2>

<p>At start up, Suneido performs a quick check of the recent activity in the database. Since the database is append only, a crash usually affects the end of the database.</p>

<p>If a problem is found then Suneido will perform a full check of the database (equivalent to running -check from the command line) and automatically attempt to repair.</p>

<p>If -check or <a href="../Database/Reference/Database/Database.Check.html">Database.Check</a> fail, this will also cause the next start up to do a full check.</p>

<p>If you run <a href="../Database/Reference/Database/Database.Check.html">Database.Check</a> (or <a href="../Database/Reference/Database/Database.Dump.html">Database.Dump</a> which does a check first) and corruption is detected then the database will be "locked", putting the system into a read-only mode. Transactions will appear to succeed, but nothing will be written to the database.</p>

<p>If corruption has been detected and the database is locked then the <a href="../Tools/Server Monitor.html">Server Monitor</a> will show:</p>

<pre>Database damage detected - operating in read-only mode</pre>
