<h2>Differences from JavaScript</h2>

<p>In Suneido:</p>

<li>You normally use .name rather than this.name</li>

<li>Only "blocks" are closures. functions do not have access to their enclosing lexical context.</li>

<li><code>return</code> from a block returns from the defining function, not just from the block.</li>

<li>Setting a member on an instance of a class will set it in the instance, even if the member exists on a super class.</li> 

<li>Classes are read-only.</li>

<li>The only inheritance is with classes and instances. There is no equivalent to JavaScript prototypes.</li>

<li>Code is in library tables in the database. Each record in a library defines a single immutable constant e.g. number, string, object, function, class.</li>

<li>Suneido Objects combine an array (unnamed values) and a map (named values). Named values are similar to JavaScript object properties. The array does not have "gaps". Any values after a gap will be in the named members.</li>

<li>Only Objects/Records and class instances have named values. There is no equivalent to JavaScript properties on other types of values.</li>

<li>There are no "primitive" values in Suneido.</li>

<li>Suneido numbers are <i>decimal</i> floating point. Numbers like .1 are represented exactly, without floating point approximation.</li> 

<li>No null or undefined. Internally Suneido has "uninitialized" values, but any attempt to use them will throw an exception so they are never "visible".</li>
