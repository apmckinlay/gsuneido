<h2>Startup</h2>

<p>When Suneido starts up, it first tries to open the database (suneido.db) in the current working directory.</p>

<p>If suneido.db is <b>not</b> found, it tries to run the command line, either as the name of a file containing a function or class, or as code to be evaluated. As with VersionMismatch, the code can only use built=in capabilities - it has no database or libraries.</p>

<p>If the database is opened successfully, it automatically <a href="../Language/Reference/Use.html">Use</a>'s "stdlib". It then calls Init (or Init.Repl for the REPL), which must be defined in stdlib.</p>

<p>The standard Init does the following:</p>

<p>If there are no command line arguments and if not a server, the default (IDE) persistent set is loaded.</p>

<p>If there are any command line arguments, Init tries to interpret them several different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>as the name of a persistent set to load<br />
e.g. <code>suneido IDE</code></li>
<li>as the name of a text file containing code to execute<br />
e.g. <code>suneido server.go</code></li>
<li>as code to be executed<br />
e.g. <code>suneido Login("IDE")</code></li>
</ul>

<p>On Windows there are three versions of Suneido:</p>
<dl>
<dt>gsuneido.exe</dt>
<dd>This is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/574911/difference-between-windows-and-console-application">Windows GUI program</a>. It includes the Win32 interface. It automatically runs the Windows message loop. stdout and stderr are appended to error.log</dd>
<dt>gsuneido.com</dt>
<dd>This is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/574911/difference-between-windows-and-console-application">Windows console program</a>. It includes the Win32 interface but it does not automatically run the Windows message loop. Because Windows runs .com before .exe, if you run just gsuneido from a command line and both are available, it will run the REPL with gsuneido.com</dd>
<dt>gsport.exe</dt>
<dd>This version should be used for the server. It does not contain the Win32 interface.</dd>
</dl>

<p>On other operating systems e.g. Linux or Mac, the executable is similar to gsport.exe.</p>

<p>When running client-server, the built date must match. If the dates do not match, the server will look for a record in stdlib called <code>VersionMismatch</code>. If it finds it, it will send it to the client, that will then execute it. This can be used, for example, to handle automatically updating the client. <b>Note:</b> the VersionMismatch code will run without a database so it can only use built-in functions and classes.</p>

<p>When GUI mode (gsuneido.exe) or <a href="Running as a Service.html">Running as a Service</a>, error output is redirected to a file. By default this is "error.log" in the current directory, but if running as a client on Windows it will be &lt;appdata&gt;/suneido&lt;port&gt;.err and on other systems it will be &lt;tempdir&gt;/suneido&lt;port&gt;.err</p>
