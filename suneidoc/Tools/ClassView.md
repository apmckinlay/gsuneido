## ClassView

ClassView allows you to view your classes 
in the form of an inheritance hierarchy tree.

-	displays classes from all the libraries currently in use.
-	collects its data on startup -
	        it won't reflect changes made while it's open.
-	currently display only - editing is not supported.


The right hand pane shows the source code of the selected class
using a Scintilla control.

**Tip:** Select Fold All from the right click context menu
of the right hand editor pane
and then click on the remaining plus sign at the top left.
This will display a list of the members of the class.
