## WorkSpace

The WorkSpace is used to run fragments of code and to access other tools.

### Find tab

Search libraries for a string, printing either just the names of the matching records, or the actual matching lines.
![](<../res/findinlibrary.png>)
Double-click on the results to go to them in [LibraryView](<LibraryView.md>).

Find by Token and Expression are slower so they runs in the background and you can use the Stop button.
