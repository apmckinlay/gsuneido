<p>The first line will fill in automatically with your company name.  You have the option of using the second line to specify a report name or other information of your choice</p>

<dl>
<dt>8.5"/11"</dt>
<dd>The 8.5" marker indicates the approximate page limit for paper in portrait format; the 11" marker is the approximate cut-off point when printing in landscape format; the font size will also be adjusted to fit the report onto the page</dd>

<dt>Column Headings</dt>
<dd>You can drag the columns to resize or rearrange but be aware of the 8.5”/11” markers which indicate the approximate cut-off points when printing</dd>
<dd>Clicking on a column heading will bring up Column Properties.  This will allow you to: 
<ul><li>Change or edit headings (e.g. Order Number instead of Order #)</li>
<li>Check the Total box so that the report shows a total for the column at the bottom of the report</li></ul></dd>

<dt>Add/Remove Columns</dt>
<dd>The options for the data source you have selected will be listed in the left hand Available box</dd>
<dd>Highlight the options you wish to use and either double click or use the <img src="../res/SelectOne.png" align="texttop" style="margin:0; padding:0;" /> button to move them to the Selected box on the right (if you make a mistake and want to remove an option from the Selected box, highlight it and either double click or use the <img src="../res/RemoveOne.png" align="texttop" style="margin:0; padding:0;" /> button)</dd>
<dd>You can move all the Selected or Available options to the other box by using the <img src="../res/SelectAll.png" align="texttop" style="margin:0; padding:0;" /> and <img src="../res/RemoveAll.png" align="texttop" style="margin:0; padding:0;" /> buttons</dd>
<dd>You can rearrange the order of your column headings by highlighting them and using the Move Up and Move Down buttons</dd>
<dd>The OK button confirms your choices which will then be displayed on the Design tab screen</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Sort tab</h3>
<img src="../res/reporterSortTab.png" />

<p>Select the Fields you wish to use to determine the order of your report (e.g. by Date in chronological order or alphabetically by Owner Operator)</p>
<p>Data with a similar value will be placed together (e.g. all the Orders for a certain Date or all the Business Partners in a particular City)</p>
<p>If you select more than one sort Field, the system will do a secondary sort within the first sort (e.g. the Orders for a particular Date could be listed in descending order based on the Billing Amount)</p>
<p>To total each group of the same value, check the Enable Totals box (e.g. if you want a total of the Orders for each particular Date); in some cases, for example, if you organize your report by SIN number, you will not be able to create a total</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>  If you want to use the <b>Enable Totals</b> feature on the Sort tab, you must check the Totals box on the Column Properties screen of the Design tab</p>

<p>To start each group of the same value on a new page, check <b>New Page for Each</b> (For example, if you are sorting by Salesperson and you want each salesperson's records to start on a new page)</p>

<p>If you check <b>Show Before</b>, each group of records will be preceded by a heading. This way you don't need to have a column for this field.</p>
