## Reporter

Reporter allows you to create a report based on information which you select and sort.  The system will also save your reports so that you can update them and use them again at another time.  The report option is available by selecting Report on the Global button or by right clicking on a screen and choosing Report.

#### New

Use the New button to start designing a new report.

#### Open...

Use the Open button to load an existing report. (Either one you previously created and saved, or one of the supplied samples.)

**Note:** You can rename or delete reports from the Open dialog by right clicking on the name of a report. WARNING: There is no way to get a report back if you delete it.

#### Save

Use the Save button to save your report.

#### Save As...

Use the Save As... button to save the current report under a different name.

The first line will fill in automatically with your company name.  You have the option of using the second line to specify a report name or other information of your choice
8.5"/11"
: The 8.5" marker indicates the approximate page limit for paper in portrait format; the 11" marker is the approximate cut-off point when printing in landscape format; the font size will also be adjusted to fit the report onto the page

Column Headings
: You can drag the columns to resize or rearrange but be aware of the 8.5”/11” markers which indicate the approximate cut-off points when printing
: Clicking on a column heading will bring up Column Properties.  This will allow you to: 
-	Change or edit headings (e.g. Order Number instead of Order #)
-	Check the Total box so that the report shows a total for the column at the bottom of the report

Add/Remove Columns
: The options for the data source you have selected will be listed in the left hand Available box
: Highlight the options you wish to use and either double click or use the ![](<../res/SelectOne.png>) button to move them to the Selected box on the right (if you make a mistake and want to remove an option from the Selected box, highlight it and either double click or use the ![](<../res/RemoveOne.png>) button)
: You can move all the Selected or Available options to the other box by using the ![](<../res/SelectAll.png>) and ![](<../res/RemoveAll.png>) buttons
: You can rearrange the order of your column headings by highlighting them and using the Move Up and Move Down buttons
: The OK button confirms your choices which will then be displayed on the Design tab screen

### Sort tab
![](<../res/reporterSortTab.png>)
Select the Fields you wish to use to determine the order of your report (e.g. by Date in chronological order or alphabetically by Owner Operator)

Data with a similar value will be placed together (e.g. all the Orders for a certain Date or all the Business Partners in a particular City)

If you select more than one sort Field, the system will do a secondary sort within the first sort (e.g. the Orders for a particular Date could be listed in descending order based on the Billing Amount)

To total each group of the same value, check the Enable Totals box (e.g. if you want a total of the Orders for each particular Date); in some cases, for example, if you organize your report by SIN number, you will not be able to create a total

**Note:**  If you want to use the **Enable Totals** feature on the Sort tab, you must check the Totals box on the Column Properties screen of the Design tab

To start each group of the same value on a new page, check **New Page for Each** (For example, if you are sorting by Salesperson and you want each salesperson's records to start on a new page)

If you check **Show Before**, each group of records will be preceded by a heading. This way you don't need to have a column for this field.

### Print tab
![](<../res/reporterPrintTab.png>)
Use Page Setup to ensure that your report is set up in the appropriate format (portrait, landscape) for this particular report
