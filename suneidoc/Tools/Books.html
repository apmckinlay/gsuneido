<h2>Books</h2>

<p><i>Books</i> are Suneido's application <i>metaphor</i>.  Suneido's help is a simple example of a book.  The SuneiDoc book contains only HTML pages, but book pages can also contain code that returns a string of HTML, or code that returns a Suneido user interface specification.</p>

<p>Application books do not have the toolbar. And in this case the sidebars have been hidden.</p>

<p>Note: The Refresh and Goto buttons will only show up when Suneido.User is 'default'</p>

<p><b>Tool Bar</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Back is similar to Back on a web browser - it takes you to the page you viewed prior to this one. Click on the down arrow to choose from a list of prior pages.</li>

<li>Forward is similar to Forward on a web browser - if you have used Back, it takes you back where you've been. Click on the down arrow to choose from a list of pages.</li>

<li>Up moves to the page before the current one.</li>

<li>Down moves to the page after the current one.</li>

<li>Print prints the current page. (Only valid for HTML pages, not program pages.) Right-click to Print Section and Print Preview to print the current page and its <i>children</i>.</li>

<li>Use the search box to search within a help book.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Tabs</b></p>

<p>The tabs below the tool bar show the main <i>chapters</i> of the book. Click on a tab to go to that section of the book. Within nested sub-menus, clicking on the tab you are in will take you "up" one level.</p>

<p><b>Bookmarks</b></p>

<p>Use the '+' to add a bookmark for the current page. You can also add a bookmark for the current page by simply double clicking on the bookmark area (not on a bookmark).</p>

<p>Use the '-' to remove the bookmark for the current page.</p>

<p>Click on a bookmark to go to that page.</p>

<p>You can drag the bookmarks to change the order, and right click to change their color.</p>

<p><b>Tree View</b></p>

<p>The optional tree on the left hand side 
shows the <i>table of contents</i> of the book.
You can use it to see where you are
and to move around in the book.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Books have a number of optional parts that you can hide or show.
The screenshot above has all its parts showing.</p>

<p>The controllable parts are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Treeview</dt>
    <dd>Click on the center arrow on the splitter to hide or show the tree view,
    or drag the splitter to adjust the size.</dd>
<dt>Bookmarks</dt>
    <dd>Click on the center arrow on the splitter to hide or show the bookmarks,
    or drag the splitter to adjust the size.

    to add a bookmark to the current page.
    Click on a bookmark to go to that page.

    </dd>

<p>Note: If run in a persistent window, like the help is, then your configuration of these parts will be saved and restored. However, if you just use Open a Book from the IDE menu, your settings will <b>not</b> be saved.</p>
