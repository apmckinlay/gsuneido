<p>ClassView allows you to view your classes 
in the form of an inheritance hierarchy tree.</p>

<ul>
    <li>displays classes from all the libraries currently in use.</li>
    <li>collects its data on startup -
        it won't reflect changes made while it's open.</li>
    <li>currently display only - editing is not supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>The right hand pane shows the source code of the selected class
using a Scintilla control.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> Select Fold All from the right click context menu
of the right hand editor pane
and then click on the remaining plus sign at the top left.
This will display a list of the members of the class.</p>
