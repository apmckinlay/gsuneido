<h3>Generators</h3>

<p>Generators are formats that produce a sequence of output items.  
They are used when it's not practical to compose all the items into a container.  
For example, the Query format is a generator 
because it wouldn't be possible to read all the results of a query at once.
</p>

<p>Generators are identified by a Generator?( ) method that returns True.  
They have a Next method that returns items 
and signals the end of the items by return False.  
They can also have a Header method 
that returns an item that will be placed at the start of each page (or False for no Header).  
</p>

<p>Generators can be nested.  
For example, <code>Library </code>is actually both an output format and a generator.  
Query generates a Library format for each record 
and Library generates a Code format for each line of source code.
