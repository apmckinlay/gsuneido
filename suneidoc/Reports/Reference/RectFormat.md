``` suneido
( item, height = item-height, width = item-width, thick = 10, outside = 120, inside = 120 )
```

Draws a box around the specified item
(which may, of course, be a container such as Horz or Vert).
The size of the box format is the size of the item plus 2 times outside + thick + inside.

The stretch is copied from the item.
