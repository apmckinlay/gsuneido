<h4>RowFormat</h4>

<pre>( format, ... data = False, font = False )</pre>

<p><code>Row</code> is the default output for <code>QueryFormat</code>.
</p>

<p>Row constructs each format.  
It then determines the correct font size (in the range 4 to 14 points) to fill the page width.
</p>

<p>A Row will be variable height if any of its formats are variable.
</p>

<p>Formats can have a "Span" member to allow them to use the space of following fields. 
A Span of 1 will combine the width of the current column and one following.  
Note: if the spanned columns had their own formats, they will be ignored.
