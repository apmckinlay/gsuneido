<h4>report.Construct</h4>

<pre>( format_spec ) => format</pre>

<p>Creates an instance of a format object.
</p>

<p>Normally accessed as _report.Construct.
</p>

<p>Takes a string containing the name of a format, 
or an object whose first member is the name of a format.  
If the name starts with a lower case letter, 
it is assumed to be a field name and the format is looked and merged with the supplied format.  
Otherwise, "Format" is appended onto the name.  
Then Construct is used to create the instance.
</p>

<p>Automatically copies the following members to the new instance with their names capitalized:
</p>

<pre>x, y, xmin, ymin, xstretch, ystretch, field, span</pre>

<p>Note: x, y, xmin, ymin values are assumed to be in inches 
and are multiplied by 1440 to convert twips.
