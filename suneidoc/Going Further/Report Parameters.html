<h2>Report Parameters</h2>

<p>For most reports it's useful to allow the user to specify options, for example which information to print, or how to print it.  Suneido refers to these options as report <i>parameters</i>.</p>

<p>To allow the user to select contacts based on their first or last names, we would add a <code><b>Params:</b></code> member to our report:</p>
<pre>
Params:
    (Vert
        (ParamsSelect firstname)
        (ParamsSelect lastname)
        )
</pre>

<p>We use a Vert to handle the layout.  For more complicated layouts, you may want to use a Form or Grid.  ParamsSelect wraps a field and provides options for selecting values similar to Select on Access.  It supports equals, greater than, ranges, etc.  The result would be:</p>

<p>Note: Parameters that are left empty select <i>all</i> values. Leaving First Name empty means we want <i>all</i> first names.</p>

<p>It is often useful to print the parameters on the report so that the user can see what they selected to get that report.  This is done with printParams:</p>
<pre>
printParams: (firstname, lastname)
</pre>

<p>For the above parameters, this would print at the top of the page:</p>
<pre>
Last Name: starts with M
</pre>

<p>It's also useful if the parameters are saved so when the user comes back to the report their previous parameters are filled in.  To do this we just have to supply a name to save them under:</p>
<pre>
name: "My Contacts Report"
</pre>

<p>This name can be whatever you like, keeping in mind that reports with the same name will <i>share</i> the same saved parameters.</p>

<p>Next we have to modify the report to actually use the parameter information.  We can do this by defining the format as a class derived from <code>QueryFormat</code>.  (<code>QueryFormat { ... }</code> defines a class derived from QueryFormat) We can then define Query as function that will return a query built from our parameters.  We can use the <code>_report.GetParamsWhere()</code> function to return the "where" portion of a query based on specified parameters. We also specify the Output of the QueryFormat as a Row with the desired columns. Your code will now look like this:</p>
<pre>
#(Params
    title: "My Contacts",
    name: 'My Contacts'
    Params:
        #(Vert
            (ParamsSelect firstname)
            (ParamsSelect lastname))
    printParams: (firstname, lastname),
    QueryFormat
        {
        Query()
            {
            return 'mycontacts' $ _report.GetParamsWhere('firstname', 'lastname')
            }
        Output:
            #(Row lastname, firstname, phone, fax, email, website)
        }
    )
</pre>

<p>Note: This version is called My_ContactsReport2 in the supplied mylib.</p>

<p>When you run this, you should get something like:</p>
