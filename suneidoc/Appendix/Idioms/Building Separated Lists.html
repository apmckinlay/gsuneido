<h3>Building Separated Lists</h3>

<p>A common task is to create a string listing several items with separators between them. It's often easier to add the separator after every item, and then at the end, remove the trailing one.</p>

<pre>
s = "";
for (x in list)
    s $= Fn(x) $ ","
s = s[..-1]
</pre>

<p>An alternative is to build an object and then use Join.</p>

<pre>
ob = Object()
for (x in list)
    ob.Add(Fn(x))
s = ob.Join(',')
</pre>

<p>Or, for this example, it's even simpler with <a href="../../Language/Reference/Object/object.Map.html">object.Map</a>:</p>

<pre>s = list.Map(Fn).Join(',')</pre>
