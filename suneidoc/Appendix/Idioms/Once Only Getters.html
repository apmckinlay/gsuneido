<h3>Once Only Getters</h3>

<pre>
getter_name()
    {
    ... 
    return .name = ... 
    }
</pre>

<p>The first time <code>.name</code> is referenced, its getter method will be evaluated, setting a member of the same name. Subsequent references to <code>.name</code> will use the member, and will not execute the method. 'name' may be either private or public (capitalized e.g. <code>Getter_Name</code>).</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> If the once method is returning an object, consider making it readonly. Since the result will be shared, you normally don't want it modified. For example:</p>
<pre>
getter_columns()
    {
    ob = Object('name')
    for (i = 0; i &lt 10; ++i)
        ob[i] = "col" $ i
    ob.Set_readonly()
    return .columns = ob
    }
</pre>
