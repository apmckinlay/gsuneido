<h3>Building a List of Unique Values</h3>

<p>One way is to use <a href="../../Language/Reference/Object/object.AddUnique.html">object.AddUnique</a> which checks if the value is already in the list before adding it:</p>

<pre>list.AddUnique(value)</pre>

<p>However, for long lists the linear search to check gets slow.</p>

<p>Another option is to make the values the members (keys) and then use <a href="../../Language/Reference/Object/object.Members.html">object.Members</a> to get a list. Named members are stored in a hash table so this is fast.</p>
<pre>
list[value] = true
...
list = list.Members()
</pre>

<p>However, this uses slightly more memory than a simple list.</p>

<p>Another option, especially if you need to sort the list anyway, is to use object.SortUnique! which sorts the list with object.Sort! and then removes duplicates in a single pass.</p> 
<pre>
list.Add(value)
...
list.SortUnique!()
</pre>

<p>However, this may use more memory if there are a lot of duplicates since they won't be removed till the end.</p>

<p>Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>for a small number of values - AddUnique is the simplest</li>

<li>for a medium number of values or lots of duplicates - use members</li>

<li>for a large number of values with few duplicates (and if sorting is ok) - use SortUnique!</li>
</ul>
