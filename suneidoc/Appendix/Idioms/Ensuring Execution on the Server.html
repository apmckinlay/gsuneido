<h3>Ensuring Execution on the Server</h3>

<p>Sometimes you want to ensure that a function or method is executed on the server (using <a href="../../Language/Reference/ServerEval.html">ServerEval</a>).</p>

<p>Requiring the callers to use ServerEval is error prone and sooner or later someone will forget.</p>

<p>One way to handle this is to have an extra method:</p>
<pre>
MyClass

class
    {
    Func(a, b, c)
        {
        ServerEval('MyClass.Func2', a, b, c)
        }
    Func2(a, b, c)
        {
        ...
        }
</pre>

<p>However, this requires two methods, and Func2 has to be public which means someone could call it directly by mistake.</p>

<p>A simpler, cleaner way to do it is to use the same function and detect whether you are running as a client (with <a href="../../Language/Reference/Client?.html">Client?</a>()):</p>
<pre>
MyFunc

function (a, b, c)
    {
    if Client?()
        ServerEval('MyFunc', a, b, c)
    else
        {
        ...
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>(This example is a standalone function, but the same approach can be used with a class method.)</p>
