<h3>Handle break and continue in Block Loops</h3>

<p>When you write a function or method that loops calling a supplied block, you should support break and continue.</p>

<p>In a block, break and continue throw "block:break" and "block:continue" respectively.</p> 

<p>To handle them write:</p>

<pre>
try
    block(args)
catch (e, "block:")
    if e is "block:break"
        break
    // else block:continue ... so continue
</pre>

<p>This takes advantage of how the catch pattern can be a prefix.</p>
