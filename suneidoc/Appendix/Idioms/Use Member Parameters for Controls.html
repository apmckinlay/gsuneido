<h3>Use Member Parameters for Controls</h3>

<p>When a user interface is fixed, you can write something like:</p>
<pre>
Controller
    {
    Controls: (...)
</pre>

<p>Or if you need to build the layout in code:</p>
<pre>
Controller
    {
    Controls()
        {
        return ...
        }
</pre>

<p>When a user interface layout depends on arguments, one way to handle it is:</p>
<pre>
Controller
    {
    New(a, b, c)
        {
        super(.controls(a, b, c))
        }
    controls(a, b, c)
        {
        return Object( ... )
        }
</pre>

<p>This works but it is somewhat verbose and you have to repeat the arguments multiple times. This can be simplified with member parameters.</p>
<pre>
Controller
    {
    New(.a, .b, .c)
        {
        }
    Controls()
        {
        // can use .a, .b, and .c here
        return ...
        }
</pre>

<p>You still need to have a <code>New</code> since it must accept the arguments, but it can be empty. (An implicit <a href="../../Language/Classes/super.html">super</a> call will be generated.)</p>

<p>Note: You could not use this approach prior to member parameters because an explicit super call must be the first line of New.</p>
<pre style="color: red;">
    New(a, b, c)
        {
        .a = a
        .b = b
        .c = c
        super() // INVALID BECAUSE NOT FIRST STATEMENT
        }
</pre>
