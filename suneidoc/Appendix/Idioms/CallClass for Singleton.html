<h3>CallClass for Singleton</h3>

<pre>
<b>MySingleton</b>

class
    {
    CallClass()
        {
        if not Suneido.Member?("MySingleton")
            Suneido.MySingleton = new MySingleton
        return Suneido.MySingleton
        }
    ...
    }
</pre>

<p>Then, to access the singleton you use MySingleton() e.g. MySingleton().Func()</p>

<p>A normal method could be used instead of CallClass e.g. Instance, but this makes using it more awkward e.g. MySingleton.Instance().Func()</p>

<p>It is conventional to use the same name for the class as the Suneido member. Often a short name makes using it nicer. But, as with all global names, try to pick a name that is not likely to clash with other people's names.</p>
