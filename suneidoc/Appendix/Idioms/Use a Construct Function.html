<h3>Use a Construct Function</h3>

<p>Use a <i>Construct</i> function to convert static object specifications into object instances. For example Report.Construct and Control.Construct accept an object where the first member is a class name, and the remaining members are arguments to the class constructor. They return the resulting instance.</p>
