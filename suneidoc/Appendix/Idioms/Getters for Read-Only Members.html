<h3>Getters for Read-Only Members</h3>

<pre>
Getter_Size()
    {
    return .size
    }
</pre>

<p>If you want to make a member public, but read-only, use a Getter_ function. Users of the member do not need to know it is using a Getter_ function - they can access it just as if it were a normal public member. For example:</p>
<pre>
thing.Size
</pre>

<p><b>Warning:</b> This will not prevent assignment to the public member, which will then override the Getter_ method.</p>
