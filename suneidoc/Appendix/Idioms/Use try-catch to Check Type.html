<h3>Use try-catch to Check Type</h3>

<p>Instead of, for example, using Object? or String? to check the type of a value, just attempt the operation.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
Indexable?

function (x)
    {
    try
        x[0]
    catch (err)
        return err is "member not found: 0" ? true : false
    return true
    }
</pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: In some cases, as in this one, you may have to use the exception to determine the result.</p>

<p>In Python this idiom is known as <i>Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission</i> (EAFP), as opposed to <i>Look Before You Leap</i> (LBYL).</p>
