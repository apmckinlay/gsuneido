### Adapter

Convert the interface of one class into an interface that other clients require.
Adapter lets you use classes in situations you otherwise wouldn't be able to.

Uses:

-	[Explorer](<../../User Interfaces/Reference/ExplorerControl.md>) 
	expects its view to have Get and Set methods that work with objects.
	[ExplorerAdapter](<../../User Interfaces/Reference/ExplorerAdapterControl.md>)lets you use a control whose Get and Set methods work with individual values.
