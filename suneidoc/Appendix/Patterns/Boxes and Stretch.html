<h3>Boxes and Stretch</h3>

<p>This is a simple method of arranging rectangular items relative to each other in a way that makes it easy to add, resize, or remove items.  Although it might appear more awkward to specify a layout this way, it is much easier to modify than if, for example, you had used a visual tool that simply recorded the exact locations of each item.</p>

<p>Items have minimum x and y dimensions as well as x and y stretch factors.  If a stretch factor is 0 then the item has a fixed size in that dimension.  If a stretch factor is greater than 0, then the item may be larger depending on the size of the container it is placed in.</p>

<p>The two most common containers in this pattern are ones that place their items one after another either horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>(Horz a b c d)</pre>

<p>would simply place items a, b, c, d side by side.</p>

<p>A "Fill" item with a minimum size of 0 and a stretch of >0 can be used to center or right/bottom justify, for example:</p>

<pre>
(Horz a Fill b)     // left justify a, right justify b
(Horz Fill a Fill)  // center a
</pre>

<p>The stretch factors can be used to divide space proportionally:</p>

<pre>(Horz (Pane xstretch: 1) (Pane xstretch: 3)</pre>

<p>would make the right hand pane three times as wide as the left hand one.</p>

<p>Of course containers can be combined and nested:</p>

<pre>(Vert (Horz a b) c)</pre>

<p>would place a and b side by side, with c below them.</p>

<p>The boxes and stretch pattern is used for user interface and report layout.</p>
