<h3>Flyweight</h3>

<p>When you need to use a lot of small, fast objects, the time it takes to create them can be excessive. An alternative is reuse objects so that you avoid the creation overhead. However, if the objects contain data that is specific to each use, then in order to reuse them, the data must be stored outside of the objects and supplied to them when they are called. The other major issue is how to know when you already have an object that you can reuse versus when you have to create a new one. If there are a limited number of different objects, you can simply create them all during initialization. Otherwise, a typical solution is to save each created object, and before creating a new one, checking whether you already have one you can use.</p>

<p>Uses:</p>

<ul>
<li>report formats for fields - the first time a field is retrieved its format is created, from then on whenever it is requested, the same format object is returned</li>

<li>the output format for Query (e.g. Row) is created once and then reused to output each record</li>
</ul>
