<h3>Adapter</h3>

<p>Convert the interface of one class into an interface that other clients require.
Adapter lets you use classes in situations you otherwise wouldn't be able to.
</p>

<p>Uses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../User Interfaces/Reference/ExplorerControl.html">Explorer</a> 
expects its view to have Get and Set methods that work with objects.
<a href="../../User Interfaces/Reference/ExplorerAdapterControl.html">ExplorerAdapter</a>
lets you use a control whose Get and Set methods work with individual values.</li>
</ul>
