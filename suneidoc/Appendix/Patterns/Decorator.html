<h3>Decorator</h3>

<p>Add extra features to objects dynamically without modifying their class or using inheritance. Also known as <i>wrappers</i>. Decorators are more flexible than inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can attach multiple decorators to the same object, whereas you can only inherit from one class</li>

<li>decorators are attached at run time, not just when you write the code</li>
</ul>

<p>Decorator is similar to Composite since a decorator has the same interface as the object it wraps. But the purpose of decorators is to add features, whereas Composite is designed to structure groups of objects.</p>

<p>Uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>ListViewModelCached is a decorator that wraps ListViewModel 
and adds caching using LruCache</li>
</ul>
