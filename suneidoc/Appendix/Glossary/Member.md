### Member

A value in an object. A member always has a name, although this name is sometimes implicit. For example: #(1, 2, a: 3, b: 4) has four members. The second two have explicit names. The member named "a" has the value 3 and the member named "b" has the value 4. The first two have implicit names. The first member has a value of 1 and an implicit name of "0" and the second member has a value of 2 and an implicit name of "1".
