<h3>Getter Method</h3>

<p>This a method that calculates the value of a member.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
class
    {
    Getter_Result()
        { return ... }
</pre>


<p>"Result" can be referenced as if it were a simple data member  (i.e. as .Result), but it's value will be what the method returns rather than a static value.</p>
