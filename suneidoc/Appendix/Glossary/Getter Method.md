### Getter Method

This a method that calculates the value of a member.

For example:

``` suneido
class
    {
    Getter_Result()
        { return ... }
```

"Result" can be referenced as if it were a simple data member  (i.e. as .Result), but it's value will be what the method returns rather than a static value.
