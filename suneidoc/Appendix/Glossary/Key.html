<h3>Key</h3>

<p>A database key consists of one or more columns that uniquely identify a row in a table.</p>

<p>Suneido makes no distinction between a <i>primary </i>key and other <i>candidate </i>keys, although it is often good design to use one key primarily.</p>

<p>Keys should be irreducible, i.e. no subset of its columns uniquely identifies rows.</p>
