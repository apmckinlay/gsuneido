### Key

A database key consists of one or more columns that uniquely identify a row in a table.

Suneido makes no distinction between a *primary *key and other *candidate *keys, although it is often good design to use one key primarily.

Keys should be irreducible, i.e. no subset of its columns uniquely identifies rows.
