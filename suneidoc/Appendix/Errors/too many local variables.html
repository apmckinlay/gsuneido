<h3>too many local variables</h3>

<p>The normal solution to this is to split up your function, often a good idea for readability anyway. Another alternative is to use an object to store a collection of variables.</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre>
a = "abra"
b = "cada"
c = "bra"
...
</pre>

<p>Use:</p>
<pre>
ob = Object()
ob.a = "abra"
ob.b = "cada"
ob.c = "bra"
...
</pre>
