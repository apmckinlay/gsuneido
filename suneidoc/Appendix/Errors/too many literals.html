<h3>too many literals</h3>

<p>A single function (or class method) is limited to 256 <i>literals</i> e.g. strings or object constants.</p>

<p>In most cases you can avoid this limit by placing large numbers of literals inside an object constant, which will then only count as a single literal.</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre>
a = "abra"
b = "cada"
c = "bra"
...
</pre>

<p>Use:</p>
<pre>
ob = #(
    a: "abra"
    b: "cada"
    c: "bra"
    ...)
</pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: Integers from -32k to +32k (16 bit) are not counted as literals.</p>
