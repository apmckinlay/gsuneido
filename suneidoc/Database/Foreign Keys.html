<h2>Foreign Keys</h2>

<p>A foreign key consists of one or more columns in one table that uniquely identify a row in another table, 
i.e. are a key in the other table.
</p>

<p>Foreign keys are specified on indexes or keys.  For example:
</p>

<pre>index (customer_id) in customers</pre>

<p>If the column names are different in the target table they can be specified:
</p>

<pre>index (customer_id) in customers (id)</pre>

<p>Rows in the source table must have a matching row in the target table.
</p>

<p>Adding a row to the source table will fail if the target table does not have a matching row.  
Likewise, updating a source row will fail if the new row does not have a matching target.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Empty foreign keys are allowed even if the target table does not have a matching row.
</p>

<p>Adding a foreign key will fail if the source rows do not have matching rows in the target table.
</p>

<p>A foreign key also places restrictions on the target table.  
Removing or updating a target row will fail if there are matching source rows.  
</p>

<p>Alternately, if cascade is specified, e.g.
</p>

<pre>index (customer_id) in customers (id) cascade</pre>

<p>then removing or updating a target row will remove or update matching source rows.
</p>

<p>Cascade can be limited to updates, e.g.
</p>

<pre>index (customer_id) in customers (id) cascade update</pre>

<p>Cascade would normally be used when the source rows <i>belong </i>to target rows.  
For example, invoice and their line items, where if you delete the invoice you also want to delete the line items, 
and if you update the invoice number, you also want to update it on the line items.
</p>

<p>Cascading updates but not deletes can be used where you want the source rows 
to stay associated with the target rows through updates, but you don't want to automatically delete.  
For example, customers and a transaction history, 
where if you change the customer id you want to update it on the transactions, 
but you don't want to allow deleting a customer if there is history.  
(You'd have to delete the history before you could delete the customer.)
