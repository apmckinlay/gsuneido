<h2>User Defined Triggers</h2>

<p>Whenever records are output, updated, or deleted from a table, the system checks for a user defined trigger
with the name "Trigger_" $ tablename</p>

<p>Triggers take three arguments, for example:</p>

<pre>
Trigger_customer
function (transaction, oldrecord, newrecord)
    {
    }
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>transaction</dt>
<dd>The containing transaction.  
This will be an update transaction since triggers are only called for update operations.</dd>
<dt>oldrecord</dt>
<dd>For updates this is the version of the record prior to the update. 
For deletes this is the record being deleted.
For outputs this will be false.</dd>
<dt>newrecord</dt>
<dd>For updates this is the new version. 
For deletes this will be false.
For outputs this will be the new record.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Triggers are only called <b>after</b> the operation succeeds.  
i.e. If the output, update, or delete fails, the trigger will not be called.</p>

<p>Any return value will be ignored.</p>
