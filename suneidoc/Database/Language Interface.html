<h2>Language Interface</h2>

<h3>Requests</h3>

<p>Requests are executed using the Database() function.  For example:</p>
<pre>
Database("create phonelist (name, phone) key(phone)")
</pre>

<h3>Queries and Updating</h3>

<p>Queries and update requests are executed using the Query method of a transaction.
For example:</p>
<pre>
t = Transaction(update:)
t.Query("delete customers where city = 'Regina'")
t.Complete()
</pre>

<p>Notice that an update transaction is required if you are modifying the database.
Also notice the use of single quotes to avoid having to escape nested quotes.</p>

<p>Where applicable, it is often better to use the block form of Transaction 
to ensure that the transaction will be ended.  For example:</p>
<pre>
Transaction(update:)
    { |t|
    t.Query("delete customers where city = 'Regina'")
    }
</pre>

<p>Or use the QueryDo function in stdlib:</p>
<pre>
QueryDo("delete customers where city = 'Regina'")
</pre>

<p>Insert, update, and delete queries return the number of records affected.</p>

<p>For a query rather than an update request, transaction.Query returns a query object
which is then used to read records.  For example:</p>
<pre>
Transaction(read:)
    { |t|
    q = t.Query("customers where city = 'Saskatoon'")
    while (false isnt (x = q.Next()))
        Print(x)
    }
</pre>

<p>Notice that in this case we only needed a read transaction.</p>

<p>The QueryApply function in stdlib simplifies this to:</p>
<pre>
QueryApply("customers where city = 'Saskatoon'")
    { |x| Print(x) }
</pre>

<p>You can also use Query1 when your query should only match a single record
(i.e. you are selecting on a key, or the table has an empty key).
Or you can use QueryFirst and QueryLast.  For example:</p>
<pre>
record = Query1("tables where tablename = 'stdlib'")
</pre>

<p>Once you've read a record from a query, you can update it or delete it.  For example:</p>
<pre>
QueryApply("inventory where price &lt; 100")
    { |x|
    if (x.price &lt; .1)
        x.Delete()
    else
        {
        x.price = x.price * 1.1
        x.Update()
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>Records can also be output to a query
(as long as the query is one that permits outputs).
For example:</p>
<pre>
Transaction(update:)
    { |t|
    q = t.Query("customers")
    q.Output(record)
    }
</pre>

<p>The QueryOutput function in stdlib simplifies this to:</p>
<pre>
QueryOutput("customers", record)
</pre>

<p>Either Object's or Record's can be output.  Records support

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>To export data to a tab delimited text file:</p>
<pre>
fields = #(name, phone, fax, email)
File("phonelist.txt", "w")
    { |f|
    QueryApply("phonelist")
        { |x|
        line = ""
        for (field in fields)
            line $= x[field] $ '\t'
        f.Writeline(line[..-1])
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>To import data from a tab delimited text file:</p>
<pre>
fields = #(name, phone, fax, email)
Database("ensure phonelist (name, phone, fax, email) key(name)")
File("phonelist.txt")
    { |f|
    while (false isnt (line = f.Readline()))
        {
        record = Record()
        values = line.Split('\t')
        for (i in values.Members())
            record[fields[i]] = values[i]
        QueryOutput("phonelist", record)
        }
    }
</pre>
