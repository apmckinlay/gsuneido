<h3>QueryApplyEach</h3>

<pre>
(query, block)
(query) { |x| ... }
</pre>

<p>Calls the block for each record from the query in an update transaction. It uses a read-only QueryApply to iterate over the query and a separate update transaction to process each record. This is useful when the process for each record is too large for QueryApplyMulti.</p>

<p>One of three related functions to iterate through a query and process each record.</p>

<p>Normal usage is like:</p>

<pre>QueryApply/Multi/Each(query)
    { |x|
    ...
    }
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><a href="QueryApply.html">QueryApply</a></dt>
<dd>Use for read-only or for updating less than 10,000 records. Uses a single update transaction so it is atomic.</dd> 

<dt><a href="QueryApplyMulti.html">QueryApplyMulti</a></dt>
<dd>Use for updating more than 10,000 records. Uses a separate update transaction for every 100 records.</dd>

<dt><a href="QueryApplyEach.html">QueryApplyEach</a></dt>
<dd>Use when there is a large amount of processing for each record. The query is iterated in a read-only transaction and each record is processed in its own RetryTransaction.</dd>
</dl>
