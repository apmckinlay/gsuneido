<h3>KeyQuery</h3>

<pre>(query, record)</pre>

<p>Build a query for a record by adding a "where" to the query using the <a href="ShortestKey.html">ShortestKey</a>. This query can be used to update or delete the record.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The record must contain the fields for the key (with the same names).</p>

<p>If the query has an empty key (no fields), then the query is returned unaltered, since there can only be at most a single record in this case.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
KeyQuery('columns', #(table: 'stdlib', column: 'num'))

    => 'columns where table = "stdlib" and column = "num"'
</pre>
