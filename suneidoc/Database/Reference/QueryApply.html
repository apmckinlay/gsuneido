<h3>QueryApply</h3>

<pre>
(query, block, update = false, dir = 'Next')
(query, update = false, dir = 'Next') { |x| ... }
</pre>

<p>To process the records in reverse order, specify dir: 'Prev'</p>

<p>One of three related functions to iterate through a query and process each record.</p>

<p>Normal usage is like:</p>

<pre>QueryApply/Multi/Each(query)
    { |x|
    ...
    }
</pre>

<dl>
<dt><a href="QueryApply.html">QueryApply</a></dt>
<dd>Use for read-only or for updating less than 10,000 records. Uses a single update transaction so it is atomic.</dd> 

<dt><a href="QueryApplyMulti.html">QueryApplyMulti</a></dt>
<dd>Use for updating more than 10,000 records. Uses a separate update transaction for every 100 records.</dd>

<dt><a href="QueryApplyEach.html">QueryApplyEach</a></dt>
<dd>Use when there is a large amount of processing for each record. The query is iterated in a read-only transaction and each record is processed in its own RetryTransaction.</dd>
</dl>

<p>QueryApply(update:) will add a key sort to the query automatically, and will throw an exception if the query already has a sort but it's not a key.</p>
