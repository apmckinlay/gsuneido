<h4>transaction.WriteCount</h4>

<pre>() => number</pre>

<p>Returns the number of "writes" that have been performed in the transaction. This is useful for debugging issues where you are exceeding the limits and getting a "too many writes" exception.</p>

<p>A "write" is either adding a record, updating a record, or removing a record. The limit is 10,000 writes per transaction.</p>
