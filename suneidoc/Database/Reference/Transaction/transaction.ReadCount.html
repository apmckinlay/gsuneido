<h4>transaction.ReadCount</h4>

<pre>() => number</pre>

<p>Returns the number of "reads" that have been performed in the transaction. This is useful for debugging issues where you are exceeding the limits and getting a "too many reads" exception.</p>

<p>A "read" is defined as accessing a range of an index. The limit is 10,000 reads on any one index.</p> 

<p>ReadCount returns the total reads for all indexes, therefore it may report a number greater than 10,000.</p>
