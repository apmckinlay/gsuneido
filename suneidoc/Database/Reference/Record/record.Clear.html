<h4>record.Clear</h4>

<p>Clears all the record data so the record is as if it was just created with Record().</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This also clears the internal information that allows a record from a table
to be updated or deleted.<br />
i.e. New? will return true and Update and Delete will fail after Clear.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: This is different from <a href="../../../Language/Reference/Object/object.Delete.html">Delete</a>(all:) which keeps the internal information.</p>
