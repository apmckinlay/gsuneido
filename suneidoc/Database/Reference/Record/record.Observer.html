<h4>record.Observer</h4>

<pre>( observer )</pre>

<p>Registers <i>observer </i>to be called whenever a member is modified.  
Multiple observers can be registered on the same record.
Observers are called in the same order they were registered.</p>

<p>Observers are also triggered by the invalidation of rules.</p>

<p>The observer call is equivalent to:</p>

<pre>record.Eval(observer, member: member)</pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: this means that if the observer wants to receive the member its parameter <u>must</u> be called "member".</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: If the observer is a method of a class, it will be called normally, and "this" will be the instance or class, <u>not</u> the record. (This is because when you get a reference to a method, the value you get is "bound" to the class or instance that you got it from.)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
f = function (member) { Print(member $ " changed to " $ this[member]) }
r = new Record
r.Observer(f)
r.a = 1
r.b = 2
</pre>

<p>would print:</p>
<pre>
a changed to 1
b changed to 2
</pre>
