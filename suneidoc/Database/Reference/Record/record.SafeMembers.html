<h4>record.SafeMembers</h4>

<pre>() => object</pre>

<p><code>rec.SafeMembers()</code> is equivalent to <code>rec.Members().Copy()</code></p>

<p>It is necessary to avoid "object modified during iteration" errors due to members being created by rules.</p>

<p>For convenience, SafeMembers is also defined on objects, in which case it is equivalent to .Members (Objects don't have rules so they don't have this issue.)</p>
