<h3>RetryTransaction</h3>

<pre>
(block)
() { |t| ... }
</pre>

<p>Executes the block in an update transaction. If the transaction fails to commit, the block is executed again (in a new transaction). After 10 tries it throws "RetryTransaction: too many retries".</p>

<p><b>Warning</b>: Beware of side effects from the block. e.g. If the block sends an email, multiple emails could end up getting sent.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
RetryTransaction()
    { |t|
    x = t.Query1('nextnumber')
    n = x.number++
    x.Update()
    }
</pre>
