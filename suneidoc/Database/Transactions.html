<h2>Transactions</h2>

<p>Access to the database occurs within "transactions".
A transaction performs a series of reads and writes "atomically"
i.e. as if they were done all at once.
Suneido transactions are "serializable",
meaning that concurrent transactions behave
as if they were done sequentially,
even though they may actually be interleaved.
This means Suneido provides "full" transactions isolation.</p>

<p>Transactions see a "snapshot" of the database as of their start time.
Modifications are not visible to other transactions
until the modifying transaction is completed.</p>

<p>Transactions can be aborted using transaction.Rollback().
All changes to the database done by the transaction will be undone.
No other transaction will have seen the updates since the transaction wasn't completed.</p>

<p>If an update transaction conflicts with another transaction,
Complete will fail and will Rollback the transaction.
An example of a conflict would be two transactions updating or deleting the same record.
It is up to the application to handle transactions that fail,
for example, by re-trying them.</p>

<p>In general, update transactions should be brief to minimize the chance of conflicts.
It is okay for read-only transactions to last longer
but it is still a good idea to complete them as soon as you're done with them.
This is because Suneido must maintain information for each open transaction
in order to provide the "virtual snapshots" of the database.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Update transactions are not designed for an unlimited number of operations.
Performance will suffer if too many operations (outputs or updates) are done
within a single transaction.
For example, adding large numbers of records (e.g. importing)
should not be done all in one transaction.
Since there is also a certain amount of overhead on each transaction,
the best compromise is to use multiple transactions,
performing a reasonable number (e.g. 100) of operations
within each transaction. 
This is the approach used by Suneido's copy and load facilities.
