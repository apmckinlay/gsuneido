<h3>Control Rules</h3>

<p>Rules can be used to send messages to controls (within a RecordControl) 
by using a special naming convention.  
For example, to have a rule determine whether a 'name' field is protected or not:</p>

<pre>
Rule_name__protect
function ()
    { return .id is ""; }
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> There must be <b>two</b> underscores between the field name and the method name.  
The method name is capitalized before being called.</p>

<p>In general, a rule called:</p>
<pre>   "Rule_" $ fieldname $ "__" $ method</pre>
<p>will translate to:</p>
<pre>   control[Method](value)</pre>

<p>Note: For this to work, the control must support the method.
Currently, FieldControl supports "valid" and "protect" methods.</p>
