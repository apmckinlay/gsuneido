<h2>Errors</h2>

<p>The database functions throw exceptions if they encounter errors.
This means you don't have to always check return values.
The occasional time you do want to allow for errors, you can use try-catch or
<a href="../Language/Reference/Catch.html">Catch</a>.

<p><b>Some general errors:</b></p>

The action could not be performed because it would not have satisfied the foreign key constraints.

<p><tt>transaction conflict</tt></p>

The action could not be performed because it would conflict with another transaction.
For example, deleting or updating a record that another transaction has deleted or updated.

<p><tt>too many overlapping update transactions</tt></p>
<blockquote>
Too many update transactions overlapping each other.  The maximum number of overlapping transactions is 500. This includes completed transactions if they overlap with an uncompleted transaction.

<p><tt>too many reads/writes</tt></p>

<p><b>temp index: derived too large:</b></p>

<p>"derived" is data that is not from the database, usually from extend although potentially also from summarize.</p>

<p>Temp indexes normally only store and sort pointers to the data in the database. But derived data isn't in the database so it has to store the data itself in memory.</p>

<p>Temp indexes often come from a sort on the query, but they can also be necessary for intermediate steps in complex queries.</p>

<p>Because there can be many users (potentially hundreds) and because the server has a finite amount of memory, Suneido has to limit how much memory is uses. Otherwise, the worst case is that the server runs out of memory and crashes. Even if it doesn't crash, excessive memory use will slow down the server for everyone.</p>

<p>One option when you encounter this error is to use a select or summarize to limit the number of records included in the query.</p>

<p>Another option is to eliminate or reduce the extends. In some cases you may be able to replace them with rules. Rules are calculated on demand rather than being stored, so they are not included in derived. However, rules will likely be slower, which is not good since sorting huge amounts of data is already going to be slow.</p>

<p>In some cases you can add an index to a table so the temp index is not required. (Although index usage also depends on other factors like selects.)</p>
