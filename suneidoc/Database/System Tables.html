<h2>System Tables</h2>

<p>Information about the database (the schema) can be viewed in the following system tables:
</p>

<p>tables - lists the tables that exist</p>

<p>columns - lists the columns for each table</p>

<p>indexes - lists the keys and indexes for each table</p>

<p>views - lists the view definitions</p>

<p>history - lists potential <a href="Reference/Transaction/transaction.Asof.html">transaction.Asof</a> date-times. Viewing the history may be slow because it has to scan potentially the entire database file. And if the database has not been compacted recently, there may be a large number of entries.</p>

<p>The contents of these tables may only be altered by the system.  However, they can be read from just like any other table.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: These are not "physical" tables. They are virtual tables that are "views" of internal metadata. <b>Warning</b>: Accessing them may be slow.</p>
