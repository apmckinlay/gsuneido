<h3>create</h3>

<pre>
<b>create</b> <i>table </i>( <i>columns </i>)
    <b>key</b> [ <b>lower</b> ] (<i>columns</i>) 
    <b>index</b> [ <b>unique</b> ] (<i>columns</i>) 
        [ <b>in</b> table [ ( columns ) [ <b>cascade</b> [ <b>update</b> ] ] ]
</pre>

<p>Create new tables. It will fail if the table already exists.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<pre>
create mytable (name, city, age, Salary)
    key(name)
    index(city)
</pre>

<p>would create a table called "mytable" with the specified columns. The Salary column would be derived by calling Rule_salary. Two indexes will be created, one on name and one on city. The key index on name will ensure that no two records have the same name.</p>

<p>Multiple key's, and index's can be specified. Keys and indexes can be composed of multiple fields.</p>

<p>The difference between a key and a unique index is that unique index are optional - multiple records can have no value, whereas for a key only one record can have no value.</p>
