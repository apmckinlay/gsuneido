<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>So you've downloaded Suneido, installed it, fired it up, and now you're sitting at something called the WorkSpace.  Now what, you ask? That's the question this section will try to answer.</p>

<p>This section will lead you step by step through creating a simple application
and deploying it both standalone and client-server. (Although this section uses Suneido's "book" interface, Suneido can, of course, also be used to create more "traditional" type Windows applications.)</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Although you'll get more out of it by actually going through the process of creating the library,  you can simply load it in (from mylib.su) via:</p>

<pre>suneido -load mylib</pre>

<p>Similarly, you can bypass creating the table by loading it in (from mycontacts.su) via:</p>

<pre>suneido -load mycontacts</pre>

<p>and bypass creating the book by loading it in (from mybook.su) via:</p>

<pre>suneido -load mybook</pre>

<p>Note: You will have to exit from Suneido and then enter these commands from a command (DOS) prompt, in your Suneido directory.</p>
