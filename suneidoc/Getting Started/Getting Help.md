## Getting Help

One of the first things you should know is how to access the documentation. You can do that by either pressing F1 or by choosing Users Manual from the Help menu. The documentation is stored in the database in the "suneidoc" table. Each page is a separate record.  The documentation is displayed in a *Book*, part of Suneido's application framework.  Books use the Internet Explorere browser control to display HTML pages.

Some tips for using Books:

-	click on the arrow halfway down the left side to open a tree view of the book
-	click on the arrow on the right side to open a bookmark area
-	click on the "+" button or double click in the bookmark area to create a bookmark for the current page
-	click on a bookmark to go to that page
-	use the field at the top right to search
-	use CTRL+F to search for text on a page
