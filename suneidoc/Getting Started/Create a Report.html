<h2>Create a Report</h2>

<p>Okay, so you've entered some contacts and now you want to print out a list
of them, so we'll create a report.  Create a new record in your library called
<code>My_ContactsReport</code></p>

<pre>
#(Params
    title: "My Contacts"
    (Query
        query: mycontacts
        )
    )
</pre>

<p>and then run:</p>

<pre>Window(My_ContactsReport)</pre>

<p>You'll see a window with three buttons - Preview, Print, and Page Setup.
Preview will display your report a page at a time in a window.  Page Setup and
Print bring up the standard Windows dialogs, allowing you to configure the
printer and print the report.</p>
