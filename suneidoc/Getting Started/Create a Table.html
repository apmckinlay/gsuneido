<h2>Create a Table</h2>

<p>As well as querying the database, you can also use QueryView for
administrative requests.  Let's create a table called mycontacts:</p>

<pre>
create mycontacts (firstname, lastname, phone, fax, email, website)
    key(lastname, firstname)
</pre>

<p>You can verify that this worked by querying your table.  You won't have any
data, but you'll see your columns.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Tables must have at least one <i>key</i>
- a unique identifying column or columns.</p>

<p>You can use SchemaView (from the WorkSpace IDE menu) to view the
<i>schema</i> (i.e. fields, keys, and indexes) of tables in the database.</p>
