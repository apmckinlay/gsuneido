<h2>LibraryView</h2>

<p>The next place you'll probably want to visit is the library browser,
Library View, available from the WorkSpace IDE menu.  Initially you'll see a
single library displayed - stdlib.  Library View normally displays all the
libraries currently in use.  Libraries are tables in the database with each
record containing the definition of one global (capitalized) name. Library View
lets you organize the contents of libraries into folders.  These folders are
purely organizational; they have no functional effect. Try opening up the
Tools folder in stdlib and select WorkSpaceControl.  The definition will show
up in the right hand pane of the Library View.  The tabs at the top of the right
hand pane allow you to easily jump back and forth between the records you're
working on.  You can close tabs via the pop up menu accessed by right clicking
on a tab.</p>

<p>Library View uses a Scintilla control (<a
href="http://www.scintilla.org">www.scintilla.org)</a> to view and edit the
source code.  Scintilla supports features like syntax styling, multiple undo
and redo, drag and drop editing, brace highlighting, indentation guides, line
markers, folding, and calltips.</p>

<p>You can also find library records using the Find tab on the WorkSpace.</p>

<p>When you exit, Suneido saves the state of <i>persistent</i> windows such as
WorkSpace, Library View, and QueryView.  This means you can adjust the size and
position of your windows and when you start up Suneido again they'll be back
where you like them.  Library View also saves the tabs so you're right back where
you left off.  (You can right click on a tab and choose Close All if you want
to start fresh.)</p>
