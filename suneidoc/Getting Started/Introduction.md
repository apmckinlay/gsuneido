## Introduction

So you've downloaded Suneido, installed it, fired it up, and now you're sitting at something called the WorkSpace.  Now what, you ask? That's the question this section will try to answer.

This section will lead you step by step through creating a simple application
and deploying it both standalone and client-server. (Although this section uses Suneido's "book" interface, Suneido can, of course, also be used to create more "traditional" type Windows applications.)

**Note:** Although you'll get more out of it by actually going through the process of creating the library,  you can simply load it in (from mylib.su) via:

``` suneido
suneido -load mylib
```

Similarly, you can bypass creating the table by loading it in (from mycontacts.su) via:

``` suneido
suneido -load mycontacts
```

and bypass creating the book by loading it in (from mybook.su) via:

``` suneido
suneido -load mybook
```

Note: You will have to exit from Suneido and then enter these commands from a command (DOS) prompt, in your Suneido directory.
