Suneido is an integrated language and database.
gSuneido is the Go implementation of Suneido.

The Suneido language is dynamically typed.
The syntax is similar to C or Java i.e. using curly braces.
Suneido code is stored in library tables in the database.
It is compiled to byte code and the byte code is interpreted.

The database is append-only.
It uses multi-version concurrency control.
It has a relational algrebra query language.

Suneido can operate either standalone or client-server.

Use "make test" to run all the Go tests
Use "make port" to make the command line version gsport.exe

Do not use: go build
When running benchmarks use -benchmem
Do not add excessive comments
Changes should follow the style of the existing code.
